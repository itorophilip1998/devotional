         "introduction":"Praise the Lord! Today begins the season of our 40 days fasting and prayers (July 1st – August 10th, 2022).  The Lord is your strength, Amen.       Fasting and prayers prepares the way for us to receive strength from God.  It is a journey, which if we acknowledge God as the one strengthening us into and through it; we will do it with ease and gain.  To walk tall and triumphant on earth, especially in this season of tribulations and attempts of taking lives, we need spiritual strength to overcome.  Spiritual strength is a tool for overcoming physical and diabolical attacks.   A brother was divinely instructed to go into fasting and prayer to ward off evil. As he obeyed, hired killers came with charms to pick him away.  They decided to hide somewhere and wait for him, after two days of not seeing him they left.  Meanwhile, the brother was in church fasting for three days.  Jesus did not only strengthen him through the fast but also shielded him from attack and charms.  That same Jesus is your strength against every unforeseen circumstance.",

         "introduction": "Fasting and prayer is often referred to as a period or season of waiting on the Lord.  Waiting signifies a time of being loaded with strength from on high. David did pray and declared: “Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even the God of our salvation, Selah (Psalm 68:19).  Divine strengthening to achieve purposes daily is what a believer receives from God as daily benefits.  In the carnal way, people smoke, drink concoctions, alcohol etc to acquire strength to do things.  Alas, look at us believers, God simply infills us with His spirit (the Holy Spirit) and that ignite, inspire and energize us to do exploit as well as our daily routines without fainting or being weary.  The Lord is your strength!  It takes discipline to wait on the Lord.  Discipline restrains.  You restrain yourself from apetite and pleasures, and you are due for a reward.  The reward is your strengthening against attacks, discouragement weariness and lowliness in life.  Amen!.",
