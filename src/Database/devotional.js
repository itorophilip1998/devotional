        "introduction": "Praise the Lord! Today begins the season of our 40 days fasting and prayers (July 1st – August 10th, 2022).  The Lord is your strength, Amen.       Fasting and prayers prepares the way for us to receive strength from God.  It is a journey, which if we acknowledge God as the one strengthening us into and through it; we will do it with ease and gain.  To walk tall and triumphant on earth, especially in this season of tribulations and attempts of taking lives, we need spiritual strength to overcome.  Spiritual strength is a tool for overcoming physical and diabolical attacks.   A brother was divinely instructed to go into fasting and prayer to ward off evil. As he obeyed, hired killers came with charms to pick him away.  They decided to hide somewhere and wait for him, after two days of not seeing him they left.  Meanwhile, the brother was in church fasting for three days.  Jesus did not only strengthen him through the fast but also shielded him from attack and charms.  That same Jesus is your strength against every unforeseen circumstance.",

        "introduction": "Fasting and prayer is often referred to as a period or season of waiting on the Lord.  Waiting signifies a time of being loaded with strength from on high. David did pray and declared: “Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even the God of our salvation, Selah (Psalm 68:19).  Divine strengthening to achieve purposes daily is what a believer receives from God as daily benefits.  In the carnal way, people smoke, drink concoctions, alcohol etc to acquire strength to do things.  Alas, look at us believers, God simply infills us with His spirit (the Holy Spirit) and that ignite, inspire and energize us to do exploit as well as our daily routines without fainting or being weary.  The Lord is your strength!  It takes discipline to wait on the Lord.  Discipline restrains.  You restrain yourself from apetite and pleasures, and you are due for a reward.  The reward is your strengthening against attacks, discouragement weariness and lowliness in life.  Amen!.",

        "introduction": "Only those who are on the wings of strength can dare fly higher in life.  Health determines the height someone can climb to in life.  Where and when a person is sick, flying high in life and making progress in his field is hindered or hampered. That’s why one of the requirements to become a high flier is good health.  Riding on the wings of strength is what God’s grace provides and bestows on those who fast and pray.  It takes strength to walk about or run around on errands or meet up with the demands of your endeavours.  What distinguishes eagles from chickens is the strength on their wings.  Eagles fly higher and chicken don’t dare fly 4ft (four feet) above the ground.  So, an eagle Christian is one who can fast and pray for days and have harvest of divine strengthening.  Whereas, the chicken Christians do not go beyond 6am to 12noon; except by favour; their exploits are not much.  We pray God grant you strength.",

        "introduction": "Grace sponsors divine strength.  Also, strength is a product of grace.  Spiritual strength is a fuel for physical strength.  Both are needed to attain success in any consideration, situation or occupation.  That is why, it is important to stress that no strength, no success. Mounting, running and walking up and upwards are functions of strength.  That is why, it is important to embark on fasting and prayer wherever and whenever success is required or demanded.  It is the period you afflict your body and soul so that your voice can be heard on high (Isa. 58:3).  In this 40-day journey, your voice shall be heard where it matters to you. Ability to dwarf others and surmount obstacles comes by this spiritual exercise and sacrifice called fasting and prayer.  As you do it, any weapon fashioned against your success shall not prosper.   God will use it to silence your opponents.  Any tongue that rise to condemn you, as you fast your prayers will condemn and if need be destroy them.  Success is yours no matter what!",

        "introduction": "Life brings joy in the face of accomplishments.  Lack of accomplishment often robs someone of joy.  The tone of Phil. 4:13 is that of joy because Christ had strengthened him (Paul) to achieve a lot in his life and ministry.  Imagine him being the only Apostle who wrote half of the books of the New Testament.  Every move you make with Christ will land you in joy and achievements. “All things” does not mean few things, certain things or selected things.  It means everything.  Meaning, when Christ strengthens a man he can succeed in business, marriage, family, politics and health-care.  The extension of it is that he will have fullness of joy; sorrow cannot sneak in. Christ is the channel of anointing for strength.  On one hand, he helps you rise up and take control of your life and conquer obstacles with ease.  On the other hand, he empowers you to nullify diabolical or satanic influences that they don’t wear you out or halt your progress.  By His strength you will surely have more wins.",

It is a case of going deep down to the depth in order to lay a foundation for a sustainable success.  This is one principle that applies to any endeavor in life and destiny. Jesus is the root of David.  He is the root and foundation for attaining immediate and remotest success.  He gives wisdom and power to overcome any fainting spirit enroute success.  He increases strength of the workman or work force to ensure the job or project is not abandoned or left half way through.  He empowers us with might or ability so that Satan will not mock at us believers that had started well to serve Him, then along the line we get discouraged. ",

As much as a person may claim that his life is well organize, if he does not make provision for renewing his strength; he is someone waiting for a day he will crash land – that is fall down unexpectedly and sustain injuries or die.  That shall not be your portion. Jesus ensures He renews your strength when you wait upon Him, in prayers, fasting and word study.  I tell you something, if your spiritual strength is renewed, your physical strength will follow suit.  Divine strengthening is a reward from Jesus for those who care to wait upon Him. Strength renewal is the route to personal revival.  When you are revived your strength gets boosted automatically.  Note too that personal revival is the key to your survival.  Survival boosts your immunity against life’s challenges – attacks, discouragements and unexpected odds.  So, a strive for strength renewal is a strive for survival.

When you wake up in the morning or during period of a long fast, it’s like you’re going to faint.

Spiritual sensitivity is like an envelope that contains revelations, knowledge or divine ideas.  It opens you to an atmosphere of inspiration and vision for creativity.  Fasting primes you to go for these set of knowledge. Experiences of being in a trance, having dreams where things are revealed to you and having pictures that tells you the way out of certain hitherto confused situations.  In short, fasting coupled with prayer fuels solutions.  Please exploit every opportunity of it.  Your mental strength is guaranteed as you fast and pray.

        "introduction": "Two classes of people are contrasted in the text above, namely: the just man and wicked man.  The first man will always rise and thrive, even though he falls, because of his innocency.  A Just man, that embarks on a fast benefits because of his right standing with God.  So, there is always a spiritual strength to make him rise after a fall. so with the wicked man; because he is not sowing a good seed and he is not having a right standing with God.  Therefore, he falls back into his mischief as a dog that goes back to his vomit.  This is why the wicked has no spiritual strength to rise after a fall. For a just man to fall seven times and still rise up each time is a tone refection of the state of his heart towards God.  King Hezekiah taught us this lesson:  see “how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart” (Isa 38:3).  God helped him revive and prevented him from falling into the grave.  A just man has a perfect heart and so will rise after each fall.  May you and I not miss this secret of recovery.",

And Jabez called on the God of Israel, saying, Oh that thou woudest bless me indeed, and enlarge my cost, and that thine hand might be with me, and that thou wouldest keep me from evil, that it may not grieve me?  And God granted him that which he requested”.",
        "introduction": "	Prayer changes things.  In the journey of life, you need prayers to bring changes in your mood and life as time goes on.  That’s why you must not enter into prayer and fasting casually but carefully, so that you know what to change or allow in your life.  You cannot be sick and you feel it is normal, without addressing it as your prayer focus.  What you address in prayer is what you achieve as your proof and testimony of answered prayers.  The prayer of Jabez has shown us the way, just in case somebody was ignorant of this.  Answered prayer is a function of the action you take and words you declare to yourself in the place of prayer.  There may be electric light in your room but until you take the action to switch on the light and tell yourself you need this light, you will still be living in darkness.  Even if you do fasting and don’t decide to take the action of turning on the socket to give you light, nothing will happen.  Your decision to effect a change is the key to answered prayers.",

        "introduction": "Nothing accords one honour like prayer.  Honour is absence of shame and sorrow.  Honour takes one to fame and makes you stand out of the crowd.  Note that other brethren were not honourable (people of honour) but Jabez was more honourable than all of them because of the rare understanding he had about prayer.  He didn’t stop there, he rose up to act.  He prayed; Prayer sponsors honour.  Honour attracts favour.  Jabez was favoured to have his condition changed from a sorrowful experience to a more honourable one.  As you pray and fast in this season, desire a change of condition – financial, marital, occupational, academic condition, from worse to good etc.  Such favour is available for you too, don’t miss it.  “And his mother called his name Jabez, saying, because I bare him with sorrow”.  In this atmosphere of prayer and fasting, refuse to allow what happened to your mother or father negatively to continue in your life and even in your own family. If you have one right now or later, rise up, positive change is possible. Pray fervently against it and God will grant your request as He did to Jabez.",

So, if you notice a repeat of what happened or is happening to them coming upon you, you need to quickly call on God to effect a change.  This is also the reason, the Churches has a time for corporate prayers and fasting like this.  One chases a thousand but two put ten thousand to flight” (Deut. 32:30).  When your personal prayer point aligns with corporate intercessory prayer against negative family influences, you are bound to have breakthrough. Like Jabez, you must decide what you should have in your life and future.  You are not to close your mouth. It is often said, a closed mouth is a closed destiny.  Psalm 81:10 – Has God’s promise for us on that – “I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt (life or sorrow): Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it”.  As you pray and fast, God will fill your life with joy and mouth with laughter; such that sorrow will have no room to infiltrate.",

        "introduction": "Jabez’s life had two phases: His life before he prayed was that of shame, sorrow, torture and frustration; because he was yet to say something against the negative weight of his name, nothing changed.  In as much as Jabez did not say anything, it was counted that he accepted his sorrowful situation.  There are many in the Church like that.  You are commanded now to say something against your painful situation. As soon as Jabez began to pray, he indicated his disagreement over what he was going through and God began to act as well by answering his prayers.  God is waiting for somebody to say something about his plight before He acts.  Note that He sees what is happening to you but prayer is the authority we give to God to act in our favour. When the church sat still over the killing of James, Herod took it one step further by attempting the killing of Peter as well.  In Chapter 12:5, the Church reacted and God acted and Peter was freed from the grip of the assissins. Can you now say like Jabez – “Lord bless me indeed and enlarge my coast”. Go ahead ",

So, you need God’s hand of favour to turn things to your advantage.  At a time David was in trouble and needed God’s hand with him to effect deliverance and he prayed: “Blessed be the LORD my strength, which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight” (Psm. 144:1).  He won the battle.  You will win as God’s hand of favour is with you. “That thine hand might be with me” Speaks of help in time of need, assistance where there was none, waving away of curses threatening family success and progress and deliverance from seen and unseen attacks.

        "introduction": "This context of the text is a version of the Lord’s Prayer: “… deliver us from evil …” (Matt. 6:13).  Jesus taught his disciples and all of us to pray for total protection throughout their day.  This constantly reminds me that such prayer works and always will.  It worked for Jabez.  So, will it work for you and me?. Prayer for total protection is very necessary in this season of kidnapping, merciless killings, onslaught of terminal diseases and numerous sicknesses.  Life thrives when we are guaranteed total protection from God.  Inside it is victory, favour, mercy, healing, deliverance, provision and even sanctification.  As honourable as Naaman was, for as long as he remained a leprous man, he never enjoyed total protection.  That’s why his little maid kept persuading him to go back to Prophet Elisha and get cleaned.  The “but” (negative stigma) in his life was not a good credential.  Read it now! “Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master and honourable, because by him the LORD had given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour but he was a leper” (2King 5:1).  That’s the evil he needed to be kept from.  Jabez was more honourable because his “but” (negative stigma) was appended to his name and profile.

Not only, you go again for children; only male children comes; you go to fast and pray again for females.  May God grant us permanent answers to our prayer requests in this season in Jesus name. Another person that enjoyed permanent answers to his prayer requests was Solomon.

This is because it is done with mutual intention and intercessory spirit.  Esther demanded “and fast ye for me”.  This should be a lesson that you cannot succeed alone. Church fasting is an example of corporate fasting.  It acquires a far more reaching conquest and favour than a single person’s fasting.  God’s word confirms: “How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up?  How we (FULGA) gain more grounds and last many years and still loading, if not by the power of corporate fasting.  The Rock of ages (God Himself) has sold (soldered us or exert a binding influence upon) us to stay focused on Him.

The reason is for mutual strengthening and harmony in our prayer focus.  Any fasting without prayer focus is an aimless venture and directionless journey.  Prayer focus shapes your spiritual sensitivity and shows your unction where, how and what it must function (or focus) on. Until you have a destination (or direction) you’re just a wonderer in the place of prayer.  Esther’s destination was “so will I go unto the King” and the fasting for three days was to bring forth accelerated favour in achieving that.  Notice that she had that at the back of her mind before she started the fasting.  That was why it was easy to communicate it to those she gathered or Mordecai gathered.  You know, a house divided against itself cannot stand, even in prayer focus. The focus of your prayer gives strength to your fasting and guides it on how to measure results or avoid distraction.

        "introduction": "Fasting is not about fame or fanfare.  It is about submitting and subjecting yourself to God’s will to be done in your life or about your request.  Fasting is a call for humility.  Humility provokes God’s amazing grace upon a person.  James 4:6 speaking says: “But he giveth more grace.  Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.  Esther was already a queen, yet she humbled herself and asked her subjects “…fast ye for me”.  Why wouldn’t God honour her with much favour?. A leader gains speed and grow faster when he has the carriage of humility.  These days, there are so many cocky people in the corridors of power, that’s why no sooner than the red carpet drawn out under their feet.  Before, they know it, they have lost out.  Though some still remain on the seat of power but have long lost their relevance only waiting for their tenure to expire.  Be guided!. In the words of 1 Peter 5:6 giving instructions for Elders (Leaders) to shepherd God’s flock well said: “Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time (7) casting all your care upon Him: for He careth for you”.  Fasting is a moment of casting all you care upon God, so do it with humility and he will exalt you as he supply you your needs liberally.  David said “I humbled my soul with fasting” (Psalm 35:11) and his prayers were always answered.  God will answer us if we do same.",

So, speak the truth from your heart. Don’t do as the Pastor that says do as I say not as I do.  Then he hides to eat when he declares a dry fast.  This will only hinder corporate success. Each of those days has special benefits released to those who obey (Hosea 6:1-3) so, if you default you stand to loose as a person and also make your group to loose in the aggregate.  Fasting anoints you with the grace to start and finish whatever you embark on, provided, you too, had started and finished your fasting duration.  So fasting is a seed for achieving success.",

        "introduction": "To be anointed to start and finish a task needs planning.  God is a God of completeness.  He wants us to exhibit same.  Esther knew this, that was why it was essential to make detailed plans about how she intended to execute the objectives of the fasting including her full participation.  Reason is, in case Mordecai’s prayer team runs into error, her own team will absorb, dissolve or resolve the error and still get the projected result. Without planning, effort will be dissipated on wasteful schemes and a lot of trial and error will set in.  But a check had already been put in place as seen above.  People who fail to plan their prayer and fasting season often look back with regrets because they realize, with the benefit of hindsight, that they could have accomplished much more with the same resources, time, opportunities and people available to them.  Esther never had such regrets because she planned for hers.  It is good that the end of a matter is better than the beginning, so if you can start something precious but you are unable to finish it, you miss out on the fullness of the purpose of whatever it is you sought to do.  Esther sought to enter the King’s court after the fasting and she succeeded (Esther 5:1-3), so shall it be in your own case.",

        "introduction": "Fasting becomes effective when what you desire or request catches your attention and you get self-motivation to go for it.  This is important because you need to have a picture of what you want – that is what you are trying to achieve in your heart through the fasting.  This will fortify you against any distraction or difficulty you may face.  However, having a dream or vision without putting in the required effort in terms of attention, focus or concentration of your prayer points on your need(s), may lead to frustration. Esther’s concentration and attention was on getting “unto the king” even if, it means to break protocol was all on her mind.  Of course, fasting is a tool for breaking protocol.  Protocol follows a calendar set by man (Esther 4:11) but God operates by His agenda.  His agenda is beyond protocol.  Fasting too helps you operate beyond protocol because of God’s presence with you and God is involved in this acceptable fasting (Isa. 58:8). So, have a mental picture of what you want from your fasting.  As this picture features in your heart and mind; so will God make it become your future.  It will feature in your future because it was what your heart had captured.  Fasting persuades God to do your heart’s desires.",

        "introduction": "Each time you fast and pray, you exchange your weakness for the strength of God.  The weakness from fasting is a declaration and confirmation that your strength is useless, because by strength can no man prevail (or succeed) – (1 Sam. 2:9).  So, you need courage to go from start to finish and succeed. Courage is boldly confronting the things you fear.  According to Esther 4:11; Death was already there for anybody who will go to the King, if not in keeping with protocol.  Esther feared losing her life and the throne as queen. Hers was not fasting but a spiritual exercise to foster courage.  However, she had courage – courage pushed her to declare “though it is not according to law: and if I perish, I perish”.  Did she perish? No! Fasting is a fuel for courage. It helps you master and foster courage to start a thing and be able to take it to the end.  Esther did it. You and I can also do it. Hear this, everyone lives in fear of one thing or another.  No matter how clear your vision, or planning you undertake, you can hardly anticipate all the odds, issues and challenges involved in starting and finishing a project, even fasting.  But courage will make you start something and finish it, in spite of our fears.",

        "introduction": "To become a cutting edge minister or a fire-brand Christian, you need to always back your ministration with fasting.  It could be before or after the ministration or both.  Ministration here refers to your performance before a congregation, crowd or gathering where you stand before people and do something that your voice is heard and people are blessed. The duration of the fast is basically your choice, however, not long days.  You may not need to fast 7 days for a 3-hour ministration. Jesus advised his disciples in Matt. 17:21 to add fasting to their prayer for quick result.  The reason is that where others fail you’ll succeed; where they were rejected, you’ll be assisted, and where you were rejected, you’ll be accepted. I release you for exploits via your ministrations.

Instruction delivers people from destruction. One day, I was on the podium preaching, in the course of it a voice said “stop and quit the stage”.  I turn round and didn’t see who was talking.

Secrets are revealed inside vision.  God speaks to those who dwell on vision.  God speaks in the middle of vision (Acts 10:19).  As Peter was thinking on the vision what is this? The Holy Ghost said – do this, do that.  God does not talk to just anybody.  When your heart is empty, your ear will be deaf.  You can’t do anything! The reasons why many have not heard the Holy Ghost say anything is because they are not dwelling on any vision (work plan to get ahead or proposal to grow in faith etc).

Why did they have to separate Paul and Barnabas? They had attained a favourable dimension of spiritual growth.  They were conversant with having fasting as a backup and they have known how to prompt or provoke the Holy Ghost to speak to them as and when need be.

Heaven is committed to back his assignment such that his work will be admired.  As he is accepted as the beloved by God, so will no man be permitted to harm him on earth.  If he is attacked, God will be the one to counter the attack by Himself.  These are the procedure and condition for sending away a minister into the preaching ministry.

        "introduction": "Everybody in human life is loaded with one problem or the other.  Because of this, help should be seen as a divine prompting to lift evident burden away from human lives around us.  By this prompting, God gives everybody the ability to help one another, one way or the other. As you help others, you are indirectly helping yourself.  Help is reciprocal.  The widow of Zarephath helped Elijah get a meal, doing so she helped herself to provoke God to supply back to her as long as she kept doing so to the man of God.  That exactly is what happens on daily basis; such that for 3 years and six months, they knew no lack. Reason with me, when you help someone provide the supply, you indirectly apply for more of God’s supply back to you.  There’s no loss with God.  You can’t lose out helping someone.  So, help is gain; help is reciprocal.  Both sides benefit.  The common denominator is obedience.  When obedience is in place, God performs on His part.",

        "introduction": "Like it was said yesterday, when you do good to someone, God Himself reciprocates good back to you. Obedience is key; but fear fights obedience. Fear does not allow people to do as they said.  It makes them feel if I do, I will fall into lack, short supply or utterly loose out.  That is not true! Elijah told the woman; “fear not; go and do as thou hast said”.  Promise and fail syndrome came up as a result of not being able to do as they had said.  Reason is fear. The devil uses fear (false evidence appearing real) to stop people from enjoying the free flow of the blessings from God.  This is the reason why there’s so much lack in the Church and in the world.  Child of God, may this lesson open your eyes today.  Helping others is the way out from escaping lack and attracting help to yourself.   Help is a seed.  Matt. 7:12 says “Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets”.  Help reciprocates when you initiate it or respond to a demand for it.  Help somebody today, help will visit you tomorrow.",

It can be released by a prayer of God bless you or a word of thank you and an action of a smile.  Any of these will translate into good returning to you.  Check if the release were to be in the reverse, you will see that it will result in bad omen. It pays to help, doing so is creating site for help to spring up and back to you.  Meaning, the more help you give to people, the more God will arrange same or other people to give to you.  It comes as a harvest.  Harvest is always much more.  Put one seed of corn in the soil, what you get as harvest is fifty seeds and above.  Help is a spiritual business transaction that yields unfailing dividends in the physical and spiritual. A man gave money to an applicant in the Church one day.  The boy smiled and said God will make you smile sir.  The man said Amen.  Unknown to both of them that God had confirmed that prayer.  A day came, this man’s son went to collect his result from school to apply for a job, while arranging his papers inside a taxi, another man next to him asked who owns this result and he said it was his.

To “sustain thee” speaks of many days, months and year’s meal and not a one-time meal.  In his heart, he knew that God will sustain her and him no matter how small the meal may be.  He remembered, still in his heart, that God had used the Ravens to sustain him by the brook (verse 3). Elijah using the word “but” in the text above was on a positive note.  He considered if she made a little meal for him first, God was going to use that to provoke multiple supplies of the meal into the woman’s pot for many days and as long as the famine will last.  The brook dried because God wanted to shift the supply from the Ravens to feed Elijah to the house of this widow.  God will shift supplies from other people to you and your household in this present economic climate. “But make me thereof a little”. Her obedience to Elijah’s demand provoked God to supply to her needs and demands in the years that went by. Pastor Dr. Mike Murdock said: “what you make happen to somebody, God will make happen to you”.  There’s a covenant of multiplication in place for whoever gives to a man of God.

The principle is that help coming to you is directly proportional to the help accruing to others from you.Then, it progresses to yield increase still to you because its coming as an harvest.Elijah helped the widow as a channel of provision coming to her.Her son was a channel of blessing of the fruit of the woman that came to her.She was an activator of divine provisions to the family.So, mutual help was operating between them.What really happened in the Zarephath of Zidon was that, God arranged His glory to come into the house of the widow whereas there was gloom in the city.Isaiah 60: 1, 2 – “Arise, Shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen upon thee(22) “A little one shall become a thousand and a small one a strong nation: I the LORD will hasten it in his time”.That means, each time a man of God enters your house, God’s glory will fill that house; as you make provision available for him, God commands the grace of multiplication to rest upon your house and resources in the time you do that.Help is coming for you!",

God over the ages never accepted the service of an hypocrite, that was why after discovering that the attention of Adam and Eve were divided, He sent them out of the place of service.  A hypocrite is a double minded person. (James 1:8). God still demands a sincere worship in our generation, so many people serve God with so many reasons, some serve because they are in lack, in good health, needs a Job and so on but service to God is limited to anything under the sun.  He says “you can’t find me until you seek me with all your heart” (Jere. 29:13). Never seek or serve God because of what you want but worship Him because of who He is.",

Note that it is the body that determines the quality of the service rendered.  The body is not our own but God’s,  so therefore glorify God with that body (1Cor. 6:20).

        "introduction": "Fear is a snare when faith in God is down played.  Children of God should take it upon themselves to ensure their faith and trust in God do not go down.  God needs to be feared or reverenced, not man. I rebuke every fear of man in the Church in Jesus name. A snare is a trap that tends to put someone on one spot for long. Trap resists progress and can even make one to stray from safety.  However, addiction to trusting in the Lord can be a quick way to banish fear of man and shatter every snare on the way.  From today, I command every snare caused by fear broken in the name of Jesus. Fear is a spoiler.  It fights faith, thwarts speed, erodes advancement and effort gets wasted. Wherever the fear of man is in place, people don’t dare to bring out their best,  thinking that they could be attacked and killed.  Therefore, trust in God is hereby negatively affected.  The text agrees that the fear of man is a snare:  but who putteth his trust in the LORD shall be safe”.  Remedy from fear is our trust in the LORD.  The fear of man would have gripped Joshua after the death of Moses and may be snare him from fulfilling his leadership responsibilities but God promptly armed him with His presence.  His trust in God got built up and safety was guaranteed.",

I plead the Holy Spirit to dismantle such evil structures in our hearts in the name of Jesus. Joseph had a heart of real love towards the brethren.  He planned for their good and took steps to ensure good things come to them.  Yet, they were still holding an attitude of fear.  We still have people who have all things working for their good and the future beaming to their advantage but they are still harbouring fear.  This day, you are being requested to dump such attitude.  Don’t look for hatred for yourself where there is none.

Reports are for the fearful whereas results run after the bold in heart.  Nebuchadnezzar plunged into regrets and stored up in a fearful surprise to declare we put three people in the fire, how come that they are now four.  “And the form of the fourth is like the son of God” (Dan 3:24 -25 KJV).  God will put fear in the heart of your enemies and they will regret that they had planned evil against you in the first place.  Every evil against you backfires from today. Light and salvation are tools that helps us overcome fear.  Fear is associated with darkness and works of the devil, that’s why it cannot withstand the blinding impact of light and the transforming virtue of salvation.  The boldness that comes with light and salvation always have commanding and challenging influence over darkness.  “Whom shall I fear? David boldly exclaimed.  Even Goliath, the giant of Gath, could not withstand his boldness, prowess and audacity. When the Lord is the strength of your life no one and nothing on earth can make you afraid.

Husband and wife, who truly love themselves do not plan to poison each other and therefore no hidden fear towards each other. 	“No fear in love depicts a love affair or a love atmosphere where the parties concerned are dwelling in absolute unity.

        "introduction": "Even though it has already been stated in Rom. 12:1,  The question now is how can I present my body as a living sacrifice to God?. First, let’s make reference to our Lord Jesus, he came in the form of flesh and paid a ransome by dying on the cross that mankind might have life, and on the third day, the scripture says He rose again by the help of the Holy Spirit. According to verse 1 of our text, we understand that the body (flesh) will first die for the spirit of God to find expressions in the life of any man.  The verse says, “That His Spirit will quicken our mortal body”. To quicken means to revive or restore.  And there can’t be a reviving without dying. So for our body to become a living sacrifice to God we must first die to sin and live by the Spirit of God.",

This means expressing a dimension of God in your life due to your experiences with him. Men like Daniel, Elijah, the three Hebrew (Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego) in the Old Testaments walked in these dimensions due to their unquenchable desire and hunger for God. No wonder the scripture in Jer. 29:13 says “And ye shall seek me and find me when ye search with all your heart”.  Please note that He didn’t say put ½ of your heart but “all your heart”.  God manifest himself in the life of people who are always ready to give him their all.  A Case study is Abraham and his Son Isaac. Even our Lord Jesus Christ laid down His all on the cross,  	that was why His father highly exalted Him and gave Him a name above every other name…”.

I believe there's no one who's reading or listening to this devotional today who has never given anything to anyone. Fine, that established, you've experienced what we're about to dig into this week. Giving is your ability to transfer your possessions or holding of something to someone especially without any intention of return. So I ask again, is there anyone listening to or reading this devotional today who has given anything to anyone without the intention of gaining back?

Beloved giving is sowing, it grows and is harvested, the harvest is often more bountiful than what was sown. Do you know your little income can bring great increase to you if you sow? Scatter your seed and wait for a bountiful harvest. It's an irony though that giving brings increase, because giving out normally should leave you in lack, but you see, God's ways are not Man's ways. Giving is a law for increase. Learn to give and see how you excel! See you at the top!",

Giving follows a spiritual principle not a personality or religion. You know Aliko Dangote sows to individuals, companies, corporations, states, and nations, now tell me how he can ever be poor again. He hast sown on very vast land, definitely, he'll reap bountifully. Believer, keeping possession means losing it (Matt.16:35). See, the surest way to financial freedom is by giving out.

No farmer having sown visits the farm daily, trampling on the seed, yet expects great yield. Beloved, the seed sown goes through a process, it doesn't just germinate. It takes time to die, that's the period you feel dry and begin regretting your decision to give, then the seed grows underground, at this stage you may be impatient and almost giving up, then the seed grows out from the soil as an immature plant, this period is very tempting as you may be tempted to pluck immature or unripe fruit from it, this can lead to its destruction, finally the seed grows to a fully mature tree ready for harvest and plucking.

Sonship is not a self-acclaimed office or title, it is one recognized by the father whose son you are. It is only your father that can boldly confirm your sonship.

        "introduction": "David! What were you doing as a king at the time kings were at the battle field? Listen, when you are not at your duty post as at when due, be rest assured that the devil will soon lure you. A local adage says that an idle man is the devil's workshop. Satan easily takes advantage of you when you are idle and at rest.  Therefore, my counsel to you is - always engage your spirit man with right thoughts and information and refuse to be found wanting in the place of your assignment as your eyes can always see 'Bathsheba bathing' when you are at home doing nothing while others are in the field. Remember this, 'a man's most pleasurable time can also be his weakest moment'",

        "introduction": "Another easy way to be drawn closer to adultery is to be given to wine (strong drink). 'And be not drunk with wine wherein is excess: but be filled with the spirit' (Eph5:18). Strong drink has a spirit and whoever is filled with its spirit will soon be deceived into the ways of foolishness and adultery, according to Prov. 6:32, - “makes one foolish”.  The spirit of strong drink is what draws a man from the house daily to go and mingle with unwise people and be exposed to detrimental things capable of puncturing or frustrating marriage. Also, anything can happen when a man is drunk, he can be senseless and full of rage against his spouse and can commit sacrilege. Noah cursed Ham his son without a cause under the influence of wine and Lot defiled her two daughters unknown to him still under the same influence (Gen 19:30-35). Don’t give the devil such access into your temple.",

Adversely, when couples begin to distrust, when they start having dual thoughts towards the actions of the other, it makes marriage develop porosity. Your best friend after God should be your spouse. You should trust, communicate, rely and depend on her as a friend to a friend. Invariably, the moment you start enjoying the company and utmostly believe another more than your spouse, be ascertained that adultery is knocking hardly on you door. In fact whoever does this is regarded as a hypocrite. Don’t shut your mouth against your spouse when hurt by her and never be action-driven by the advice of another or befriend someone else, no matter who they are to you so closely more than your spouse. Remember, you are at the chance of corrupting good manners (chastity) when you locate and allocate yourself with wrong people ",

        "introduction": "Another lever or activator of adultery is a negation of rights or benevolence among couples. One thing expected of couples is that they bear each other's burden and yoke. It is a mutual responsibility. Second is that couples should not defraud each other. This is to say that they should not refuse each other’s body from sexual pleasure (1Cor 7:5). The only time this is permitted is when fasting and praying at the agreement or consent of one another. This can also explain that the effectuality of such prayer is abortive if one disagrees while another persist. Listen believer, there are billions of others who are eagerly waiting out there to do to your spouse what you see as burden doing for him/her. Render each other their due right, especially the sexual rights as this is the most macro contributor to adultery in marriage today and even in Christian marriages. ",

        "introduction": "When a man's heart goes after other things not given to be so, he's committed adultery. This is why the word whore or the words 'go a- whoring' is/was mostly used by God against the Israelites when they worshipped baal. This means many who were in harmonious relationship with God have committed adultery against him when they disobeyed.  Seemingly, like disobedience, many reasons are attached to adultery in marriages. Some include childlessness, dissatisfaction, intrusion from family acquaintances and even couples themselves. Marriage is held in high esteem by God and therefore none of these mentioned should stop the marital relationship. Note that your marriage is between you and your couple and not with your father, mother, in-laws, friends, children etc. It is therefore a step towards adultery for any to prefer children or highly esteem family relations or even for your heart to go after others aside your spouse.",

On his own, he wouldn't have conceived the evil of wife snatching but a woman who knew that her bathroom was proxy to the king's palace situated upstairs was bathing downstairs without roofs or coverage.  Brethren, the urge for unchasity (the quality or state of being sexually immoral) is very conflagration and dynamite. The scripture juxtaposes it with fire and therefore should be tamed. The only safe way to combating this explosive urge that can result in adultery is for the wonderful and beautiful creatures made in God's image and likeness to take responsibility of 'roofing their bathrooms', that's covering our bodies well.  Seductive dressing is one great tool in the hands of the devil to spread immorality. Let us not all the way blame David. Brothers, sisters, mommies, daddies, let us be well covered- it's our mutual responsibility to silence the temptation to adultery.",

Even when you have your papers to show them, they will still find one thing or the other to accuse you of, so that they can extort money from you. In our text, Capernaum is a pleasant city; it serves as a nerve centre of commercial activities. On the other hand, Capernaum speaks of a city where one is facing financial embarrassment.  It’s a place where one is being ridiculed because one can’t pay bills as at when due. It is equally a location where people smile at you but at the back of their minds they declare you a debtor. I pray for you this day, the city where you are living in or travelling to should not be a Capernaum to you.  That is to say may God deliver you from any form of financial harassment today.

They are happy with that name because it brings money into their pockets, mostly in a dubious way.  May they not harass you today. Jesus and His disciples were confronted by task-force people at a place called Capernaum.  As partially seen yesterday; Capernaum is a place where people gossip you on your inability to pay school fees.  I pray God delivers you from any form of financial embarrassment.  Financial challenges are not restricted to poor or low income people.  The rich people also face financial challenges at their own level.  They may be able to pay bills but they can equally run into a financial challenge of having sufficient funds to expand their businesses. Whatever it is, God will still deliver you from it.

This was the time when people pray before going out in the morning.  This was the time people heightened their intimacy with God and distanced themselves from the world; a time of careful planning as against careless living. Capernaum is a seaport, a place close to the seashore.  By reason of its location, most times come under attack by marine powers.  These posers cast a spell on people and make them spend their money in a careless and lavish way.  It is after the money has finished or gone down drastically that they remember they are yet to pay their bills.  Before they know it, they are already on the hook of tribute money collectors, school fees and other bills demands. Every child of God needs this timely discernment – to make God have a share in their money in tithes and offerings.  This will stop the devourer who comes as marine powers and evil forces from witchcraft covers which pushes people into riotous living and unreasonable spending.  (Mal. 3:10-12).

The tribute money people saw the boldness of Peter and felt convinced, he is with the money of the master – though Peter was not, it was Judas Iscariot that kept Jesus money. Boldness is an exalted level of self-confidence.  It makes you qualify as a person who could defend his master, the group or anything.  According to Eccl. 7:12 – “Money is a defense…”.  Peter showcased a personality of a defender.  Of a truth God used him to defend the master (Matt. 7:27).  The money for the tribute actually came through Peter.

It paid off at the end because Peter settled the matter with them. There is nothing a child of God, a man in business or a Pastor in Church needs like an able assistant.  Peter was able to fit into it and that shoe fits him.  How do you assist people get things done? Do you back out? Or shy away from helping out?  This is another crucial question to you; child of God or man of God. It is good to assist others today, because tomorrow you’ll need someone to assist you.  It is very rare to see people assist someone whole-heartedly and selflessly.  Many assist others because of the gain they are going to make.  Not so with Peter, he assisted in the ministry of Jesus wholeheartedly.  What did he get?

Two of it are thinking positively and having a growth mindset. For instance saying; I can improve my skills with much effort and practice.  His mindset or way of thinking is towards progress and future achievement. David hearing Goliath talked stirred the championship spirit in him.
