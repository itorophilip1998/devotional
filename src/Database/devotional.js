    introduction:
      "Praise the Lord! Today begins the season of our 40 days fasting and prayers (July 1st – August 10th, 2022).  The Lord is your strength, Amen.       Fasting and prayers prepares the way for us to receive strength from God.  It is a journey, which if we acknowledge God as the one strengthening us into and through it; we will do it with ease and gain.  To walk tall and triumphant on earth, especially in this season of tribulations and attempts of taking lives, we need spiritual strength to overcome.  Spiritual strength is a tool for overcoming physical and diabolical attacks.   A brother was divinely instructed to go into fasting and prayer to ward off evil. As he obeyed, hired killers came with charms to pick him away.  They decided to hide somewhere and wait for him, after two days of not seeing him they left.  Meanwhile, the brother was in church fasting for three days.  Jesus did not only strengthen him through the fast but also shielded him from attack and charms.  That same Jesus is your strength against every unforeseen circumstance.",

    introduction:
      "Fasting and prayer is often referred to as a period or season of waiting on the Lord.  Waiting signifies a time of being loaded with strength from on high. David did pray and declared: “Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even the God of our salvation, Selah (Psalm 68:19).  Divine strengthening to achieve purposes daily is what a believer receives from God as daily benefits.  In the carnal way, people smoke, drink concoctions, alcohol etc to acquire strength to do things.  Alas, look at us believers, God simply infills us with His spirit (the Holy Spirit) and that ignite, inspire and energize us to do exploit as well as our daily routines without fainting or being weary.  The Lord is your strength!  It takes discipline to wait on the Lord.  Discipline restrains.  You restrain yourself from apetite and pleasures, and you are due for a reward.  The reward is your strengthening against attacks, discouragement weariness and lowliness in life.  Amen!.",

    introduction:
      "Only those who are on the wings of strength can dare fly higher in life.  Health determines the height someone can climb to in life.  Where and when a person is sick, flying high in life and making progress in his field is hindered or hampered. That’s why one of the requirements to become a high flier is good health.  Riding on the wings of strength is what God’s grace provides and bestows on those who fast and pray.  It takes strength to walk about or run around on errands or meet up with the demands of your endeavours.  What distinguishes eagles from chickens is the strength on their wings.  Eagles fly higher and chicken don’t dare fly 4ft (four feet) above the ground.  So, an eagle Christian is one who can fast and pray for days and have harvest of divine strengthening.  Whereas, the chicken Christians do not go beyond 6am to 12noon; except by favour; their exploits are not much.  We pray God grant you strength.",

    introduction:

Both are needed to attain success in any consideration, situation or occupation.  That is why, it is important to stress that no strength, no success. Mounting, running and walking up and upwards are functions of strength.  That is why, it is important to embark on fasting and prayer wherever and whenever success is required or demanded.  It is the period you afflict your body and soul so that your voice can be heard on high (Isa. 58:3).  In this 40-day journey, your voice shall be heard where it matters to you. Ability to dwarf others and surmount obstacles comes by this spiritual exercise and sacrifice called fasting and prayer.  As you do it, any weapon fashioned against your success shall not prosper.   God will use it to silence your opponents.  Any tongue that rise to condemn you, as you fast your prayers will condemn and if need be destroy them.  Success is yours no matter what!",

    introduction:
      "Life brings joy in the face of accomplishments.  Lack of accomplishment often robs someone of joy.  The tone of Phil. 4:13 is that of joy because Christ had strengthened him (Paul) to achieve a lot in his life and ministry.  Imagine him being the only Apostle who wrote half of the books of the New Testament.  Every move you make with Christ will land you in joy and achievements. “All things” does not mean few things, certain things or selected things.  It means everything.  Meaning, when Christ strengthens a man he can succeed in business, marriage, family, politics and health-care.  The extension of it is that he will have fullness of joy; sorrow cannot sneak in. Christ is the channel of anointing for strength.  On one hand, he helps you rise up and take control of your life and conquer obstacles with ease.  On the other hand, he empowers you to nullify diabolical or satanic influences that they don’t wear you out or halt your progress.  By His strength you will surely have more wins.",

It is a case of going deep down to the depth in order to lay a foundation for a sustainable success.  This is one principle that applies to any endeavor in life and destiny. Jesus is the root of David.  He is the root and foundation for attaining immediate and remotest success.  He gives wisdom and power to overcome any fainting spirit enroute success.

As much as a person may claim that his life is well organize, if he does not make provision for renewing his strength; he is someone waiting for a day he will crash land – that is fall down unexpectedly and sustain injuries or die.  That shall not be your portion. Jesus ensures He renews your strength when you wait upon Him, in prayers, fasting and word study.  I tell you something, if your spiritual strength is renewed, your physical strength will follow suit.  Divine strengthening is a reward from Jesus for those who care to wait upon Him. Strength renewal is the route to personal revival.  When you are revived your strength gets boosted automatically.  Note too that personal revival is the key to your survival.  Survival boosts your immunity against life’s challenges – attacks, discouragements and unexpected odds.  So, a strive for strength renewal is a strive for survival.

Spiritual sensitivity is like an envelope that contains revelations, knowledge or divine ideas.  It opens you to an atmosphere of inspiration and vision for creativity.  Fasting primes you to go for these set of knowledge. Experiences of being in a trance, having dreams where things are revealed to you and having pictures that tells you the way out of certain hitherto confused situations.  In short, fasting coupled with prayer fuels solutions.  Please exploit every opportunity of it.  Your mental strength is guaranteed as you fast and pray.

A Just man, that embarks on a fast benefits because of his right standing with God.  So, there is always a spiritual strength to make him rise after a fall. so with the wicked man; because he is not sowing a good seed and he is not having a right standing with God.  Therefore, he falls back into his mischief as a dog that goes back to his vomit.  This is why the wicked has no spiritual strength to rise after a fall. For a just man to fall seven times and still rise up each time is a tone refection of the state of his heart towards God.  King Hezekiah taught us this lesson:  see “how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart” (Isa 38:3).  God helped him revive and prevented him from falling into the grave.  A just man has a perfect heart and so will rise after each fall.  May you and I not miss this secret of recovery.",

    introduction:
      "	Prayer changes things.  In the journey of life, you need prayers to bring changes in your mood and life as time goes on.  That’s why you must not enter into prayer and fasting casually but carefully, so that you know what to change or allow in your life.  You cannot be sick and you feel it is normal, without addressing it as your prayer focus.  What you address in prayer is what you achieve as your proof and testimony of answered prayers.  The prayer of Jabez has shown us the way, just in case somebody was ignorant of this.  Answered prayer is a function of the action you take and words you declare to yourself in the place of prayer.  There may be electric light in your room but until you take the action to switch on the light and tell yourself you need this light, you will still be living in darkness.  Even if you do fasting and don’t decide to take the action of turning on the socket to give you light, nothing will happen.  Your decision to effect a change is the key to answered prayers.",

    introduction:
      "Nothing accords one honour like prayer.  Honour is absence of shame and sorrow.  Honour takes one to fame and makes you stand out of the crowd.  Note that other brethren were not honourable (people of honour) but Jabez was more honourable than all of them because of the rare understanding he had about prayer.  He didn’t stop there, he rose up to act.  He prayed; Prayer sponsors honour.  Honour attracts favour.  Jabez was favoured to have his condition changed from a sorrowful experience to a more honourable one.  As you pray and fast in this season, desire a change of condition – financial, marital, occupational, academic condition, from worse to good etc.  Such favour is available for you too, don’t miss it.  “And his mother called his name Jabez, saying, because I bare him with sorrow”.  In this atmosphere of prayer and fasting, refuse to allow what happened to your mother or father negatively to continue in your life and even in your own family. If you have one right now or later, rise up, positive change is possible. Pray fervently against it and God will grant your request as He did to Jabez.",

So, if you notice a repeat of what happened or is happening to them coming upon you, you need to quickly call on God to effect a change.  This is also the reason, the Churches has a time for corporate prayers and fasting like this.  One chases a thousand but two put ten thousand to flight” (Deut. 32:30).  When your personal prayer point aligns with corporate intercessory prayer against negative family influences, you are bound to have breakthrough. Like Jabez, you must decide what you should have in your life and future.  You are not to close your mouth. It is often said, a closed mouth is a closed destiny.  Psalm 81:10 – Has God’s promise for us on that – “I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt (life or sorrow): Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it”.

    introduction:
      "Jabez’s life had two phases: His life before he prayed was that of shame, sorrow, torture and frustration; because he was yet to say something against the negative weight of his name, nothing changed.  In as much as Jabez did not say anything, it was counted that he accepted his sorrowful situation.  There are many in the Church like that.  You are commanded now to say something against your painful situation. As soon as Jabez began to pray, he indicated his disagreement over what he was going through and God began to act as well by answering his prayers.  God is waiting for somebody to say something about his plight before He acts.  Note that He sees what is happening to you but prayer is the authority we give to God to act in our favour. When the church sat still over the killing of James, Herod took it one step further by attempting the killing of Peter as well.

So, you need God’s hand of favour to turn things to your advantage.  At a time David was in trouble and needed God’s hand with him to effect deliverance and he prayed: “Blessed be the LORD my strength, which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight” (Psm. 144:1).  He won the battle.  You will win as God’s hand of favour is with you. “That thine hand might be with me” Speaks of help in time of need, assistance where there was none, waving away of curses threatening family success and progress and deliverance from seen and unseen attacks.

    introduction:
      "This context of the text is a version of the Lord’s Prayer: “… deliver us from evil …” (Matt. 6:13).  Jesus taught his disciples and all of us to pray for total protection throughout their day.  This constantly reminds me that such prayer works and always will.  It worked for Jabez.  So, will it work for you and me?. Prayer for total protection is very necessary in this season of kidnapping, merciless killings, onslaught of terminal diseases and numerous sicknesses.  Life thrives when we are guaranteed total protection from God.  Inside it is victory, favour, mercy, healing, deliverance, provision and even sanctification.  As honourable as Naaman was, for as long as he remained a leprous man, he never enjoyed total protection.  That’s why his little maid kept persuading him to go back to Prophet Elisha and get cleaned.  The “but” (negative stigma) in his life was not a good credential.  Read it now! “Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master and honourable, because by him the LORD had given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour but he was a leper” (2King 5:1).

This is because it is done with mutual intention and intercessory spirit.  Esther demanded “and fast ye for me”.  This should be a lesson that you cannot succeed alone. Church fasting is an example of corporate fasting.  It acquires a far more reaching conquest and favour than a single person’s fasting.  God’s word confirms: “How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up?  How we (FULGA) gain more grounds and last many years and still loading, if not by the power of corporate fasting.  The Rock of ages (God Himself) has sold (soldered us or exert a binding influence upon) us to stay focused on Him.

Prayer focus shapes your spiritual sensitivity and shows your unction where, how and what it must function (or focus) on. Until you have a destination (or direction) you’re just a wonderer in the place of prayer.  Esther’s destination was “so will I go unto the King” and the fasting for three days was to bring forth accelerated favour in achieving that.  Notice that she had that at the back of her mind before she started the fasting.  That was why it was easy to communicate it to those she gathered or Mordecai gathered.  You know, a house divided against itself cannot stand, even in prayer focus. The focus of your prayer gives strength to your fasting and guides it on how to measure results or avoid distraction.

    introduction:
      "Fasting is not about fame or fanfare.  It is about submitting and subjecting yourself to God’s will to be done in your life or about your request.  Fasting is a call for humility.  Humility provokes God’s amazing grace upon a person.  James 4:6 speaking says: “But he giveth more grace.  Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.  Esther was already a queen, yet she humbled herself and asked her subjects “…fast ye for me”.  Why wouldn’t God honour her with much favour?. A leader gains speed and grow faster when he has the carriage of humility.  These days, there are so many cocky people in the corridors of power, that’s why no sooner than the red carpet drawn out under their feet.  Before, they know it, they have lost out.  Though some still remain on the seat of power but have long lost their relevance only waiting for their tenure to expire.  Be guided!. In the words of 1 Peter 5:6 giving instructions for Elders (Leaders) to shepherd God’s flock well said: “Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time (7) casting all your care upon Him: for He careth for you”.  Fasting is a moment of casting all you care upon God, so do it with humility and he will exalt you as he supply you your needs liberally.  David said “I humbled my soul with fasting” (Psalm 35:11) and his prayers were always answered.  God will answer us if we do same.",

So, speak the truth from your heart. Don’t do as the Pastor that says do as I say not as I do.  Then he hides to eat when he declares a dry fast.  This will only hinder corporate success. Each of those days has special benefits released to those who obey (Hosea 6:1-3) so, if you default you stand to loose as a person and also make your group to loose in the aggregate.  Fasting anoints you with the grace to start and finish whatever you embark on, provided, you too, had started and finished your fasting duration.  So fasting is a seed for achieving success.",

Esther knew this, that was why it was essential to make detailed plans about how she intended to execute the objectives of the fasting including her full participation.  Reason is, in case Mordecai’s prayer team runs into error, her own team will absorb, dissolve or resolve the error and still get the projected result. Without planning, effort will be dissipated on wasteful schemes and a lot of trial and error will set in.  But a check had already been put in place as seen above.  People who fail to plan their prayer and fasting season often look back with regrets because they realize, with the benefit of hindsight, that they could have accomplished much more with the same resources, time, opportunities and people available to them.  Esther never had such regrets because she planned for hers.  It is good that the end of a matter is better than the beginning, so if you can start something precious but you are unable to finish it, you miss out on the fullness of the purpose of whatever it is you sought to do.

    introduction:
      "Fasting becomes effective when what you desire or request catches your attention and you get self-motivation to go for it.  This is important because you need to have a picture of what you want – that is what you are trying to achieve in your heart through the fasting.  This will fortify you against any distraction or difficulty you may face.  However, having a dream or vision without putting in the required effort in terms of attention, focus or concentration of your prayer points on your need(s), may lead to frustration. Esther’s concentration and attention was on getting “unto the king” even if, it means to break protocol was all on her mind.  Of course, fasting is a tool for breaking protocol.  Protocol follows a calendar set by man (Esther 4:11) but God operates by His agenda.  His agenda is beyond protocol.  Fasting too helps you operate beyond protocol because of God’s presence with you and God is involved in this acceptable fasting (Isa. 58:8). So, have a mental picture of what you want from your fasting.  As this picture features in your heart and mind; so will God make it become your future.  It will feature in your future because it was what your heart had captured.  Fasting persuades God to do your heart’s desires.",

    introduction:
      "Each time you fast and pray, you exchange your weakness for the strength of God.  The weakness from fasting is a declaration and confirmation that your strength is useless, because by strength can no man prevail (or succeed) – (1 Sam. 2:9).  So, you need courage to go from start to finish and succeed. Courage is boldly confronting the things you fear.  According to Esther 4:11; Death was already there for anybody who will go to the King, if not in keeping with protocol.  Esther feared losing her life and the throne as queen. Hers was not fasting but a spiritual exercise to foster courage.  However, she had courage – courage pushed her to declare “though it is not according to law: and if I perish, I perish”.  Did she perish? No! Fasting is a fuel for courage. It helps you master and foster courage to start a thing and be able to take it to the end.  Esther did it. You and I can also do it. Hear this, everyone lives in fear of one thing or another.  No matter how clear your vision, or planning you undertake, you can hardly anticipate all the odds, issues and challenges involved in starting and finishing a project, even fasting.  But courage will make you start something and finish it, in spite of our fears.",

      "To become a cutting edge minister or a fire-brand Christian, you need to always back your ministration with fasting.  It could be before or after the ministration or both.  Ministration here refers to your performance before a congregation, crowd or gathering where you stand before people and do something that your voice is heard and people are blessed. The duration of the fast is basically your choice, however, not long days.  You may not need to fast 7 days for a 3-hour ministration. Jesus advised his disciples in Matt. 17:21 to add fasting to their prayer for quick result.  The reason is that where others fail you’ll succeed; where they were rejected, you’ll be assisted, and where you were rejected, you’ll be accepted. I release you for exploits via your ministrations.

Instruction delivers people from destruction. One day, I was on the podium preaching, in the course of it a voice said “stop and quit the stage”.  I turn round and didn’t see who was talking.

Secrets are revealed inside vision.  God speaks to those who dwell on vision.  God speaks in the middle of vision (Acts 10:19).  As Peter was thinking on the vision what is this? The Holy Ghost said – do this, do that.  God does not talk to just anybody.  When your heart is empty, your ear will be deaf.  You can’t do anything! The reasons why many have not heard the Holy Ghost say anything is because they are not dwelling on any vision (work plan to get ahead or proposal to grow in faith etc).

    introduction:
      "Everybody in human life is loaded with one problem or the other.  Because of this, help should be seen as a divine prompting to lift evident burden away from human lives around us.  By this prompting, God gives everybody the ability to help one another, one way or the other. As you help others, you are indirectly helping yourself.  Help is reciprocal.  The widow of Zarephath helped Elijah get a meal, doing so she helped herself to provoke God to supply back to her as long as she kept doing so to the man of God.  That exactly is what happens on daily basis; such that for 3 years and six months, they knew no lack. Reason with me, when you help someone provide the supply, you indirectly apply for more of God’s supply back to you.  There’s no loss with God.  You can’t lose out helping someone.  So, help is gain; help is reciprocal.  Both sides benefit.  The common denominator is obedience.  When obedience is in place, God performs on His part.",

    introduction:
      "Like it was said yesterday, when you do good to someone, God Himself reciprocates good back to you. Obedience is key; but fear fights obedience. Fear does not allow people to do as they said.  It makes them feel if I do, I will fall into lack, short supply or utterly loose out.  That is not true! Elijah told the woman; “fear not; go and do as thou hast said”.  Promise and fail syndrome came up as a result of not being able to do as they had said.  Reason is fear. The devil uses fear (false evidence appearing real) to stop people from enjoying the free flow of the blessings from God.  This is the reason why there’s so much lack in the Church and in the world.  Child of God, may this lesson open your eyes today.  Helping others is the way out from escaping lack and attracting help to yourself.   Help is a seed.  Matt. 7:12 says “Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets”.

To “sustain thee” speaks of many days, months and year’s meal and not a one-time meal.  In his heart, he knew that God will sustain her and him no matter how small the meal may be.  He remembered, still in his heart, that God had used the Ravens to sustain him by the brook (verse 3). Elijah using the word “but” in the text above was on a positive note.  He considered if she made a little meal for him first, God was going to use that to provoke multiple supplies of the meal into the woman’s pot for many days and as long as the famine will last.  The brook dried because God wanted to shift the supply from the Ravens to feed Elijah to the house of this widow.  God will shift supplies from other people to you and your household in this present economic climate. “But make me thereof a little”. Her obedience to Elijah’s demand provoked God to supply to her needs and demands in the years that went by.

The principle is that help coming to you is directly proportional to the help accruing to others from you.Then, it progresses to yield increase still to you because its coming as an harvest.Elijah helped the widow as a channel of provision coming to her.Her son was a channel of blessing of the fruit of the woman that came to her.She was an activator of divine provisions to the family.So, mutual help was operating between them.What really happened in the Zarephath of Zidon was that, God arranged His glory to come into the house of the widow whereas there was gloom in the city.Isaiah 60: 1, 2 – “Arise, Shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen upon thee(22) “A little one shall become a thousand and a small one a strong nation: I the LORD will hasten it in his time”.That means, each time a man of God enters your house, God’s glory will fill that house; as you make provision available for him, God commands the grace of multiplication to rest upon your house and resources in the time you do that.Help is coming for you!",

I plead the Holy Spirit to dismantle such evil structures in our hearts in the name of Jesus. Joseph had a heart of real love towards the brethren.  He planned for their good and took steps to ensure good things come to them.  Yet, they were still holding an attitude of fear.  We still have people who have all things working for their good and the future beaming to their advantage but they are still harbouring fear.  This day, you are being requested to dump such attitude.  Don’t look for hatred for yourself where there is none.  No evil will be permitted to visit you because the love of God is coming on strong in your case daily. 	Have an attitude of gratitude to God for the peaceful or favourable life He has given to you.  Learn to celebrate Jesus for dying on the cross for your safety and salvation.  Believe that lines are falling for you in pleasant places and nothing of shame, sorrow and fears will come your way.",

God’s eyes are on you to ensure you do not go hopeless on earth.  He has plans good enough for us to make us keep smiling, singing and dancing all day. God speaks to each of us in Jeremiah 29:11 – “For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thought of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end”.  God’s expected end for you is to live long and enjoy a life devoid of fear.  No matter the level of hatred, danger or terrorism planned for you today, the Heavenly authorities have upturned everything and trend of events to work in your favour.  Before you woke up from bed today, it has already been declared that “it will be well with you today and days ahead”.  Cheer up! Go out confidently and walk majestically!. You fear (reverence) God and God cannot allow you to fear anything else or create room for fear to grip you.  Your hope is in His mercy.  He will surely be merciful unto you and do you good even beyond your heart desire.  I can see God beaming His watchful eyes of care and protection; announcing to the devil that you are untouchable.

Reports are for the fearful whereas results run after the bold in heart.  Nebuchadnezzar plunged into regrets and stored up in a fearful surprise to declare we put three people in the fire, how come that they are now four.  “And the form of the fourth is like the son of God” (Dan 3:24 -25 KJV).  God will put fear in the heart of your enemies and they will regret that they had planned evil against you in the first place.  Every evil against you backfires from today. Light and salvation are tools that helps us overcome fear.  Fear is associated with darkness and works of the devil, that’s why it cannot withstand the blinding impact of light and the transforming virtue of salvation.  The boldness that comes with light and salvation always have commanding and challenging influence over darkness.  “Whom shall I fear? David boldly exclaimed.  Even Goliath, the giant of Gath, could not withstand his boldness, prowess and audacity. When the Lord is the strength of your life no one and nothing on earth can make you afraid.

No farmer having sown visits the farm daily, trampling on the seed, yet expects great yield. Beloved, the seed sown goes through a process, it doesn't just germinate. It takes time to die, that's the period you feel dry and begin regretting your decision to give, then the seed grows underground, at this stage you may be impatient and almost giving up, then the seed grows out from the soil as an immature plant, this period is very tempting as you may be tempted to pluck immature or unripe fruit from it, this can lead to its destruction, finally the seed grows to a fully mature tree ready for harvest and plucking. The problem is the impatience of most believers for this stage to come. May God enable us to wait till the full maturity of our seed.  It is sure that what you give will come back to you, even more.",

Beloved, manifestation is for confirmed sons, not relatives, servants or self-acclaimed sons; it is for the sons that have been confirmed by God.

    introduction:
      "There is a city in Eastern Nigeria which is notable for subjecting people to financial harassment and embarrassment in the guise of tax drive.  They don’t care who you are.  Even when you have your papers to show them, they will still find one thing or the other to accuse you of, so that they can extort money from you. In our text, Capernaum is a pleasant city; it serves as a nerve centre of commercial activities. On the other hand, Capernaum speaks of a city where one is facing financial embarrassment.  It’s a place where one is being ridiculed because one can’t pay bills as at when due. It is equally a location where people smile at you but at the back of their minds they declare you a debtor. I pray for you this day, the city where you are living in or travelling to should not be a Capernaum to you.  That is to say may God deliver you from any form of financial harassment today.  God will arrange for you unexpected financial favour.  You have been helping people, may God give you a harvest of financial blessing to day in Jesus name, Amen.",

    introduction:
      "Tribute money takers specialize in liking to mete out ill-treatment to people.  They are commonly addressed as task-force people.  They are happy with that name because it brings money into their pockets, mostly in a dubious way.  May they not harass you today. Jesus and His disciples were confronted by task-force people at a place called Capernaum.  As partially seen yesterday; Capernaum is a place where people gossip you on your inability to pay school fees.  I pray God delivers you from any form of financial embarrassment.  Financial challenges are not restricted to poor or low income people.  The rich people also face financial challenges at their own level.  They may be able to pay bills but they can equally run into a financial challenge of having sufficient funds to expand their businesses. Whatever it is, God will still deliver you from it. Another perspective of Capernaum is that, it is a city where instead of people to help you, they go round to advertise you in bad light and mock you that there’s no money in your pocket.  As you call Jesus, this morning, He is taking you beyond that level.",

    introduction:
      "The word “when” indicates that there was a time people were not financially stranded in this city.  People were able to pay bills without hassles.  This was the time when people pray before going out in the morning.  This was the time people heightened their intimacy with God and distanced themselves from the world; a time of careful planning as against careless living. Capernaum is a seaport, a place close to the seashore.  By reason of its location, most times come under attack by marine powers.  These posers cast a spell on people and make them spend their money in a careless and lavish way.  It is after the money has finished or gone down drastically that they remember they are yet to pay their bills.  Before they know it, they are already on the hook of tribute money collectors, school fees and other bills demands. Every child of God needs this timely discernment – to make God have a share in their money in tithes and offerings.  This will stop the devourer who comes as marine powers and evil forces from witchcraft covers which pushes people into riotous living and unreasonable spending.  (Mal. 3:10-12).  Tithing shields you from evil hands and would not allow them perform their fetish enterprises with your finances.",

He is somebody that God must bless his hand work so that he/she can be your channel of financial favour.  Peter is a type of somebody when he/she makes money (through your prayers or ministration) will not run away from you but will be available to setter your bills and his own. In the story of Jesus, the tribute money people didn’t go to Him, they went to Peter.  May God lay it on somebody’s heart to settle your bills today.  May your life not run on human calendar but on God’s agenda today.  Human calendar will place load on you, as you’ll be thinking of the date and appointment you gave to somebody to come and collect money from you.

That is, the person whom people trusts that whatever you say will work good for him/them.  Note: This is not somebody or people who will say Amen to your prophetic declarations upon them but will turn round to doubt if you’re a child of God or man of God.

    introduction:
      "Of all the disciples of Jesus Christ, boldness singled Peter out.  One crucial trait money gives to the person that has or carry it is exclusive boldness.  The tribute money people saw the boldness of Peter and felt convinced, he is with the money of the master – though Peter was not, it was Judas Iscariot that kept Jesus money. Boldness is an exalted level of self-confidence.  It makes you qualify as a person who could defend his master, the group or anything.  According to Eccl. 7:12 – “Money is a defense…”.  Peter showcased a personality of a defender.  Of a truth God used him to defend the master (Matt. 7:27).  The money for the tribute actually came through Peter.  As a matter of truth, Peter didn’t fail them or their expectation.  May God make it that any time people have certain good expectation about you, you will be able to live up to it to the glory of God",

(Verse 25)  Nothing brings quarrel like when a question is being asked, no one wants to answer.  Peter’s answer gave them the assurance that he (Peter) was the right person to talk to.  It paid off at the end because Peter settled the matter with them. There is nothing a child of God, a man in business or a Pastor in Church needs like an able assistant.  Peter was able to fit into it and that shoe fits him.  How do you assist people get things done? Do you back out? Or shy away from helping out?  This is another crucial question to you; child of God or man of God. It is good to assist others today, because tomorrow you’ll need someone to assist you.  It is very rare to see people assist someone whole-heartedly and selflessly.  Many assist others because of the gain they are going to make.  Not so with Peter, he assisted in the ministry of Jesus wholeheartedly.  What did he get? He got impartation that made him succeed in his endeavours after Jesus had handed to him (John 21:14-20) May this teach you to serve and assist a leader for the reason of impartation.",

      "A champion is someone who emerges in the midst of others.  He towers above others in strength, performance and in winning battles or trophies.  Goliath was a champion who had won wars and been in the limelight as a renowned champion for many years.  These credentials gave him the guts to come out and challenge Israel to a fight for 40 days. What makes up a champion is not merely his skin colour, physical height and bodily shape.  It is the established set of attitudes held by him or her.  Two of it are thinking positively and having a growth mindset. For instance saying; I can improve my skills with much effort and practice.  His mindset or way of thinking is towards progress and future achievement. David hearing Goliath talked stirred the championship spirit in him.  He wondered why Goliath had to threaten his Elder brothers, King Saul and all other warriors in Israel for 40 days.  No one will succeed in quenching the championship light in you.

    introduction:
      "A champion constantly yearns for the topmost top and that does not depend on his years on earth.  He is always rated higher than the rest because of his agility, ability and dexterity never at all on seniority.   Championship ability is based on a mindset not on a man’s setting or status.  So, age cannot, will not and should not place a limit on you or him/her. David was the youngest, yet God ordained him above his three eldest brothers who were war veterans with King Saul.  That’s destiny for you.  “So then, it is not of him that willeth, not of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy”.  (Rom. 9:16).  Destiny most times answers to God’s mercy.  Don’t kill yourself if your junior does better than you in a particular field.  Watch out for yours, there’s an area destiny has also smiled on you for excellence and supremacy over your junior.  However, the junior should not forget to be humble if he doesn’t want to go down.  Read this: “A man’s pride shall bring him low, but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit”. (Prov. 29:23). In “Things fall apart” Okonkwo said those whose palm kernel are not cracked by them, but by excellent spirit should not forget to be humble.  Age is just a number and is not equal to wonder.

    introduction:
      "“Age is an issue of mind over matter, if you don’t mind, it doesn’t matter” according to Mark Twain.  Winning is first on the mind before it happens in the physical.  A mind of championship, be it on a young man or old man will surely manifest a champion.  Yesterday, we saw this mind on David, a youth.  Today, we are seeing it on Caleb, an old man.  Caleb silenced fear in the people of Israel, when he ordered that they should go and fight the sons of Anak (Giants) win and possess back their land. Henry Ford said: “Anyone who stops learning is old whether at twenty or eighty.  Anyone who keeps learning stays young.  The greatest thing in life is to keep your mind young”.  Caleb, though old was still young at heart.  He had the spirit of a young man, even at 85 years of age.  God Himself commended him.  “But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit (spirit of a champion and being young at heart) with him, and had followed me fully, him will I bring into the land where into he went; and his seed shall possess it” (Num. 14:24).  The rest died in the wilderness because of fear and for lacking the spirit of a champion.  May you not be numbered among such; brave through for breakthrough.  Victor Hugo said “Forty is the old age of youth, fifty the youth of old age”.  You’re not too old to set a goal.",

      "Repentance is the route to salvation in Christ.  Many people are of the illusion that since they received deliverance and began to serve God, they have as well been saved or obtained salvation.  It goes deeper than that.  Repentance is total withdrawal from sin; to enjoy full salvation in Christ.  Beloved, it is noteworthy that salvation speaks of total liberty.  It is a desire from God to set man free from sin and every satanic bondage.  Meanwhile, deliverance from attack or life’s challenges is just the beginning of a divine touch.  In this regard one delivered from troubles or pains has need to endear his or herself to God who has lots more to give in the package of salvation.",

Brethren these things must not be otherwise preferred or placed against the scriptural order that would be our attempt to oppose divinity.  Realize that deliverance is first assured to settle individual state of mind, and holiness must be introduced to guarantee divine presence and acceptance. Note, as men under the bondage of sin, sickness and load of burdens can’t, in their trouble perceive or assimilate divine leading unto holiness, so likewise a man who is not safe can’t accommodate the possession or gifts of God.  He’ll either waste it or the possession destroys him.  When delivered, desire holiness before demanding possessions.",

It’s funny to see people introduce spiritual gifts, prosperity and divine power to unsafe souls and immature convert.  In plain speech an immoral, un-repented person cannot be boasting of being a spiritual tongue speaker, except maybe it’s such as Saul’s experience among the prophets (I Sam 10:11).

      "Your spiritual quotient plays a role in enhancing your spiritual conquests.  What you conquer spiritually, gets conquered physically.  That’s why your level of endowment determines the quality of service you can render to God and man.  I  pray for you that God empowers you afresh daily for exploits and your light keep shining brightly. I am sure you know about Intelligence Quotient (IQ). There is something more important.  It is called Spiritual Quotient (SQ).  Though both are virtues and gifts, the difference between IQ and SQ has in the letter 1 in Intelligence and S in Spiritual.  People with very high IQ like Albert Einstein are normally very productive intellectually.  It is easy for them to achieve the dreams they are committed to.  It is the same thing Spiritual Quotient which begins when you give your life to Christ.  God’s righteousness through and the fruit of the Spirit become yours.  As you pray and receive other Christian experiences you become more empowered for exploits. You may ask: Do all Christians have the same SQ?  No! As it is with IQ, so it is with SQ.  All gifts –physical, mental or spiritual – come from God.  We are told in 1 Corinthians 12:11 that by the Holy Spirit, He gives to every man severally as he will!  You may not be as endowed as Peter or Paul but you can let your own light shine in your own corner.   Don’t let your SQ waste",

    introduction:
      "Time or timing is one tool that can help any man strike a balance between busyness and laziness. On the positive side: Busyness is a season of coming on strong in your activity.  At that period, your activity yields productivity whereas laziness season is when you call off on your activity.  It is a kind of time off, either to rest inorder to regain strength or check your health from deteriorating.  At his time no work is done. On the negative side, when the stop work period is too long, it is termed laziness; that is reluctance to go into work or unwillingness to do anything.  This is bad and unacceptable before God and man.  Reason is:  such behaviour is a pointer to laxity into inactivity.  On the other hand, busyness speaks of intensity of activity.  Meaning work is done and result or yield is seen but if the busyness results in activity without productivity, then such too, is not acceptable by God and man.  Reason is: more time and money have been spent attending social functions and ceremonies at the expense of going for evangelism and soul winning as a believer or a church. 	Balance calls for elimination of excesses; a little time to work and a little time to rest, a little time to attend social functions and a little time to focus on prayers and soul winning.

Justice signifies that fairness should be promoted in our dealings with God and people so that no side is cheated.  In other words, equality (or equal right) should be allowed to prevail. To strike a balance or maintain justice, caution must play a role.  A just man is a man of caution.  He does his things orderly, with care and prudence; so that if he makes mistakes he can retrace his steps and put things aright.  I pray you become a just man or woman from today. A just man follows the path of justice and plays his role with caution.  That’s why even if he falls seven times, he can still rise up.

Those you called your enemies are not there by mistake.  They are there for a purpose – for God to use them and re-write your story based on what God will ask you to do for them or them to you.  As upright as Job was, they found many faults in him.  But it was those faults that God used, and asked Job to forgive them, pray for them for a change of Job’s story.  As Job obeyed, his own miracle ensued.  Don’t ever give up doing good to your enemies because your miracle, through God using them, is on the way. I wish you pray for yourself as Jesus did in John 17:4 – “I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou giveth me to do”.  This year your acts and activities shall glorify God.  Your scheduled tasks divinely bestowed upon you shall be completed.  You will not have any carry-over.  You’ll cross over the year without any carry over (without things left undone) in Jesus name.",

    introduction:
      "Keep sowing your seeds in the soil of this earth, in the lives of human beings and into the coffers for God’s work and be ready to receive your harvest and get your pay back. Your joy shall be full as your harvest shall be plenty and very rewarding.  God has pitched your life and endeavours on the fourth ground and your labour shall surely be sweet and profitable.  Joy unspeakable is a product of tears uncountable.  Now, is the season of that harvest. 	Attitude of sacrifice is the access to your rising to the ultimate divinely programmed for you.  Sacrifices are seeds sown not as convenient but as commanded.  They are seeds sown in tears and deep pains.  That’s how the price is paid and felt.  At last, such sacrifices do bring joy that last long and that means finishing well.  Solomon did so in 1 Kings 3:3-4 with a sacrifice of “a thousand burnt offerings” and God made him become the richest and wisest King that ever lived.  ",

    text: "Matthew 4:8-11 – “And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou will fall down and worship me (10) Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve (11) Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him”.",
    introduction:
      "Satanic manipulations are what give birth to temptations.  Temptations come to give trouble to any person targeted.  Trouble does not discriminate.  It troubles everybody. Job tells us that a man that is born of a woman is of few days and is full of trouble but when hurdle of trouble is broken by your deliberate refusal to yield  to satanic manipulations; angelic ministration gain access to your edification and fortification.  In this season of the year may Jesus enable you to overcome every temptation. Martin Luther King Junior Once said: “the ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and inconvenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy”.  If Jesus did not overcome Satan’s temptation believers would have faced much more challenges than we have now and our confessions of faith would have been shrouded in outrageous controversy.  God is faithful that He used Jesus to give us a way to escape temptations - (1 Cor. 10:33). Every temptation targets to make us commit character flow where our faith shifts from God to the devil (Matt. 4:7-9).  So to finish strong and finish well, we must develop an attitude of believing that we can brave through with God on our side and Christ as our strengthener - (Phil. 4:13).  This is where angels are released to come to our aid.  You’ll not fail God in this year end",

    text: "Psalm 126:1-3 – “When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream” – verse 1.",
    introduction:
      "When God turns people’s stories around for the better; it is always like a dream.  It is often a twinkle of an eye experience.  It could come through one connection you have, kind gesture you give, new level you are or sacrifices you have made.  I see God turning your ugly situation for good and beauty for ashes (beauty in place of ashes). How? It takes courage to brave through to arrive at this level.  These days’ people need to work on their endurance quotient.  Their habits are fill with impatience and absence of major breakthroughs.  Job 14:14; Job determined and held on to an inspired decision to press on and pass the endurance test.  Hear him: “If a man die, shall he live again?  All the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come”.  This resolve gave birth to his captivity turning experience far into his story in chapter 42:10 which we quote last Wednesday. God is willing to turn-around the captivity of the church and our nations but it needs our courage to endure till it comes at the appropriate time.  The church too needs to push (pray until something happens).  As God did for the early church in the days of Peter - (Acts 12:5, 7-16).  It was like a dream and they were astonished that their prayers caused an angel to enter the prison and bring Peter back to them.  A new joy is breaking forth for the church before the year runs out.",

    introduction:
      "Every time you take yourself up on the ladder of purity, God takes you higher on the hierarchy of authority – (Dan. 1:8, 20).  Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego are proven examples.  You must hold on to the conviction that you can survive and still excel without recourse to immorality.  Immorality can fight your rising into Excellency.  Stop it before it stops you.  It stopped Sampson. The next thing that you must shun is idolatry, if you want to rise to the peak.  Practicing idolatry is indirectly fighting God.  Who has every fought with his maker and prosper? (Isa. 45:9).  Worshipping idols shows that God cannot meet your needs, which is wrong.  This is why the magicians and astrologers went down for Daniel and his three friends to go up ten times higher.  When you trust in the Excellency of God, God will entrust into your life the grace to be upwardly mobile. The magicians and astrologers started well along with Daniel and his three friends but they did not finish strong and finish well, (like Daniel and Co.) because they lost their intimacy with God in the course of their journey.  I don’t know how you started this year but my wish to you is:  You must finish well!",
