         "introduction":"Praise the Lord! Today begins the season of our 40 days fasting and prayers (July 1st – August 10th, 2022).  The Lord is your strength, Amen.       Fasting and prayers prepares the way for us to receive strength from God.  It is a journey, which if we acknowledge God as the one strengthening us into and through it; we will do it with ease and gain.  To walk tall and triumphant on earth, especially in this season of tribulations and attempts of taking lives, we need spiritual strength to overcome.  Spiritual strength is a tool for overcoming physical and diabolical attacks.   A brother was divinely instructed to go into fasting and prayer to ward off evil. As he obeyed, hired killers came with charms to pick him away.  They decided to hide somewhere and wait for him, after two days of not seeing him they left.  Meanwhile, the brother was in church fasting for three days.  Jesus did not only strengthen him through the fast but also shielded him from attack and charms.  That same Jesus is your strength against every unforeseen circumstance.",

         "introduction": "Fasting and prayer is often referred to as a period or season of waiting on the Lord.  Waiting signifies a time of being loaded with strength from on high. David did pray and declared: “Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even the God of our salvation, Selah (Psalm 68:19).  Divine strengthening to achieve purposes daily is what a believer receives from God as daily benefits.  In the carnal way, people smoke, drink concoctions, alcohol etc to acquire strength to do things.  Alas, look at us believers, God simply infills us with His spirit (the Holy Spirit) and that ignite, inspire and energize us to do exploit as well as our daily routines without fainting or being weary.  The Lord is your strength!  It takes discipline to wait on the Lord.  Discipline restrains.  You restrain yourself from apetite and pleasures, and you are due for a reward.  The reward is your strengthening against attacks, discouragement weariness and lowliness in life.  Amen!.",

         "introduction": "Only those who are on the wings of strength can dare fly higher in life.  Health determines the height someone can climb to in life.  Where and when a person is sick, flying high in life and making progress in his field is hindered or hampered. That’s why one of the requirements to become a high flier is good health.  Riding on the wings of strength is what God’s grace provides and bestows on those who fast and pray.  It takes strength to walk about or run around on errands or meet up with the demands of your endeavours.  What distinguishes eagles from chickens is the strength on their wings.  Eagles fly higher and chicken don’t dare fly 4ft (four feet) above the ground.  So, an eagle Christian is one who can fast and pray for days and have harvest of divine strengthening.  Whereas, the chicken Christians do not go beyond 6am to 12noon; except by favour; their exploits are not much.  We pray God grant you strength.",

Both are needed to attain success in any consideration, situation or occupation.  That is why, it is important to stress that no strength, no success.

It is the period you afflict your body and soul so that your voice can be heard on high (Isa. 58:3).  In this 40-day journey, your voice shall be heard where it matters to you. Ability to dwarf others and surmount obstacles comes by this spiritual exercise and sacrifice called fasting and prayer.  As you do it, any weapon fashioned against your success shall not prosper.

The tone of Phil. 4:13 is that of joy because Christ had strengthened him (Paul) to achieve a lot in his life and ministry.  Imagine him being the only Apostle who wrote half of the books of the New Testament.  Every move you make with Christ will land you in joy and achievements. “All things” does not mean few things, certain things or selected things.  It means everything.  Meaning, when Christ strengthens a man he can succeed in business, marriage, family, politics and health-care.  The extension of it is that he will have fullness of joy; sorrow cannot sneak in. Christ is the channel of anointing for strength.  On one hand, he helps you rise up and take control of your life and conquer obstacles with ease.  On the other hand, he empowers you to nullify diabolical or satanic influences that they don’t wear you out or halt your progress.  By His strength you will surely have more wins.",

As much as a person may claim that his life is well organize, if he does not make provision for renewing his strength; he is someone waiting for a day he will crash land – that is fall down unexpectedly and sustain injuries or die.  That shall not be your portion. Jesus ensures He renews your strength when you wait upon Him, in prayers, fasting and word study.  I tell you something, if your spiritual strength is renewed, your physical strength will follow suit.  Divine strengthening is a reward from Jesus for those who care to wait upon Him. Strength renewal is the route to personal revival.  When you are revived your strength gets boosted automatically.  Note too that personal revival is the key to your survival.  Survival boosts your immunity against life’s challenges – attacks, discouragements and unexpected odds.  So, a strive for strength renewal is a strive for survival.

Spiritual sensitivity is like an envelope that contains revelations, knowledge or divine ideas.  It opens you to an atmosphere of inspiration and vision for creativity.  Fasting primes you to go for these set of knowledge. Experiences of being in a trance, having dreams where things are revealed to you and having pictures that tells you the way out of certain hitherto confused situations.  In short, fasting coupled with prayer fuels solutions.  Please exploit every opportunity of it.  Your mental strength is guaranteed as you fast and pray.

         "introduction": "Two classes of people are contrasted in the text above, namely: the just man and wicked man.  The first man will always rise and thrive, even though he falls, because of his innocency.  A Just man, that embarks on a fast benefits because of his right standing with God.  So, there is always a spiritual strength to make him rise after a fall. so with the wicked man; because he is not sowing a good seed and he is not having a right standing with God.  Therefore, he falls back into his mischief as a dog that goes back to his vomit.  This is why the wicked has no spiritual strength to rise after a fall. For a just man to fall seven times and still rise up each time is a tone refection of the state of his heart towards God.  King Hezekiah taught us this lesson:  see “how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart” (Isa 38:3).  God helped him revive and prevented him from falling into the grave.  A just man has a perfect heart and so will rise after each fall.  May you and I not miss this secret of recovery.",

         "introduction": "	Prayer changes things.  In the journey of life, you need prayers to bring changes in your mood and life as time goes on.  That’s why you must not enter into prayer and fasting casually but carefully, so that you know what to change or allow in your life.  You cannot be sick and you feel it is normal, without addressing it as your prayer focus.  What you address in prayer is what you achieve as your proof and testimony of answered prayers.  The prayer of Jabez has shown us the way, just in case somebody was ignorant of this.  Answered prayer is a function of the action you take and words you declare to yourself in the place of prayer.  There may be electric light in your room but until you take the action to switch on the light and tell yourself you need this light, you will still be living in darkness.  Even if you do fasting and don’t decide to take the action of turning on the socket to give you light, nothing will happen.  Your decision to effect a change is the key to answered prayers.",

         "introduction": "Nothing accords one honour like prayer.  Honour is absence of shame and sorrow.  Honour takes one to fame and makes you stand out of the crowd.  Note that other brethren were not honourable (people of honour) but Jabez was more honourable than all of them because of the rare understanding he had about prayer.  He didn’t stop there, he rose up to act.  He prayed; Prayer sponsors honour.  Honour attracts favour.  Jabez was favoured to have his condition changed from a sorrowful experience to a more honourable one.  As you pray and fast in this season, desire a change of condition – financial, marital, occupational, academic condition, from worse to good etc.  Such favour is available for you too, don’t miss it.  “And his mother called his name Jabez, saying, because I bare him with sorrow”.  In this atmosphere of prayer and fasting, refuse to allow what happened to your mother or father negatively to continue in your life and even in your own family. If you have one right now or later, rise up, positive change is possible. Pray fervently against it and God will grant your request as He did to Jabez.",

When your personal prayer point aligns with corporate intercessory prayer against negative family influences, you are bound to have breakthrough. Like Jabez, you must decide what you should have in your life and future.  You are not to close your mouth. It is often said, a closed mouth is a closed destiny.  Psalm 81:10 – Has God’s promise for us on that – “I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt (life or sorrow): Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it”.  As you pray and fast, God will fill your life with joy and mouth with laughter; such that sorrow will have no room to infiltrate.",

In as much as Jabez did not say anything, it was counted that he accepted his sorrowful situation.  There are many in the Church like that.  You are commanded now to say something against your painful situation. As soon as Jabez began to pray, he indicated his disagreement over what he was going through and God began to act as well by answering his prayers.  God is waiting for somebody to say something about his plight before He acts.  Note that He sees what is happening to you but prayer is the authority we give to God to act in our favour. When the church sat still over the killing of James, Herod took it one step further by attempting the killing of Peter as well.

You will win as God’s hand of favour is with you. “That thine hand might be with me” Speaks of help in time of need, assistance where there was none, waving away of curses threatening family success and progress and deliverance from seen and unseen attacks.

Jesus taught his disciples and all of us to pray for total protection throughout their day.  This constantly reminds me that such prayer works and always will.  It worked for Jabez.  So, will it work for you and me?. Prayer for total protection is very necessary in this season of kidnapping, merciless killings, onslaught of terminal diseases and numerous sicknesses.  Life thrives when we are guaranteed total protection from God.  Inside it is victory, favour, mercy, healing, deliverance, provision and even sanctification.  As honourable as Naaman was, for as long as he remained a leprous man, he never enjoyed total protection.  That’s why his little maid kept persuading him to go back to Prophet Elisha and get cleaned.  The “but” (negative stigma) in his life was not a good credential.  Read it now! “Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master and honourable, because by him the LORD had given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour but he was a leper” (2King 5:1).  That’s the evil he needed to be kept from.  Jabez was more honourable because his “but” (negative stigma) was appended to his name and profile.

This is because it is done with mutual intention and intercessory spirit.  Esther demanded “and fast ye for me”.  This should be a lesson that you cannot succeed alone. Church fasting is an example of corporate fasting.  It acquires a far more reaching conquest and favour than a single person’s fasting.  God’s word confirms: “How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up?  How we (FULGA) gain more grounds and last many years and still loading, if not by the power of corporate fasting.  The Rock of ages (God Himself) has sold (soldered us or exert a binding influence upon) us to stay focused on Him.

The reason is for mutual strengthening and harmony in our prayer focus.  Any fasting without prayer focus is an aimless venture and directionless journey.  Prayer focus shapes your spiritual sensitivity and shows your unction where, how and what it must function (or focus) on. Until you have a destination (or direction) you’re just a wonderer in the place of prayer.  Esther’s destination was “so will I go unto the King” and the fasting for three days was to bring forth accelerated favour in achieving that.  Notice that she had that at the back of her mind before she started the fasting.  That was why it was easy to communicate it to those she gathered or Mordecai gathered.  You know, a house divided against itself cannot stand, even in prayer focus. The focus of your prayer gives strength to your fasting and guides it on how to measure results or avoid distraction.

         "introduction": "Fasting is not about fame or fanfare.  It is about submitting and subjecting yourself to God’s will to be done in your life or about your request.  Fasting is a call for humility.  Humility provokes God’s amazing grace upon a person.  James 4:6 speaking says: “But he giveth more grace.  Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.  Esther was already a queen, yet she humbled herself and asked her subjects “…fast ye for me”.  Why wouldn’t God honour her with much favour?. A leader gains speed and grow faster when he has the carriage of humility.  These days, there are so many cocky people in the corridors of power, that’s why no sooner than the red carpet drawn out under their feet.  Before, they know it, they have lost out.  Though some still remain on the seat of power but have long lost their relevance only waiting for their tenure to expire.  Be guided!. In the words of 1 Peter 5:6 giving instructions for Elders (Leaders) to shepherd God’s flock well said: “Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time (7) casting all your care upon Him: for He careth for you”.  Fasting is a moment of casting all you care upon God, so do it with humility and he will exalt you as he supply you your needs liberally.

So, speak the truth from your heart. Don’t do as the Pastor that says do as I say not as I do.  Then he hides to eat when he declares a dry fast.  This will only hinder corporate success. Each of those days has special benefits released to those who obey (Hosea 6:1-3) so, if you default you stand to loose as a person and also make your group to loose in the aggregate.  Fasting anoints you with the grace to start and finish whatever you embark on, provided, you too, had started and finished your fasting duration.  So fasting is a seed for achieving success.",

         "introduction": "To be anointed to start and finish a task needs planning.  God is a God of completeness.  He wants us to exhibit same.  Esther knew this, that was why it was essential to make detailed plans about how she intended to execute the objectives of the fasting including her full participation.  Reason is, in case Mordecai’s prayer team runs into error, her own team will absorb, dissolve or resolve the error and still get the projected result. Without planning, effort will be dissipated on wasteful schemes and a lot of trial and error will set in.  But a check had already been put in place as seen above.  People who fail to plan their prayer and fasting season often look back with regrets because they realize, with the benefit of hindsight, that they could have accomplished much more with the same resources, time, opportunities and people available to them.  Esther never had such regrets because she planned for hers.  It is good that the end of a matter is better than the beginning, so if you can start something precious but you are unable to finish it, you miss out on the fullness of the purpose of whatever it is you sought to do.  Esther sought to enter the King’s court after the fasting and she succeeded (Esther 5:1-3), so shall it be in your own case.",

         "introduction": "Fasting becomes effective when what you desire or request catches your attention and you get self-motivation to go for it.  This is important because you need to have a picture of what you want – that is what you are trying to achieve in your heart through the fasting.  This will fortify you against any distraction or difficulty you may face.  However, having a dream or vision without putting in the required effort in terms of attention, focus or concentration of your prayer points on your need(s), may lead to frustration. Esther’s concentration and attention was on getting “unto the king” even if, it means to break protocol was all on her mind.  Of course, fasting is a tool for breaking protocol.  Protocol follows a calendar set by man (Esther 4:11) but God operates by His agenda.  His agenda is beyond protocol.  Fasting too helps you operate beyond protocol because of God’s presence with you and God is involved in this acceptable fasting (Isa. 58:8). So, have a mental picture of what you want from your fasting.  As this picture features in your heart and mind; so will God make it become your future.  It will feature in your future because it was what your heart had captured.  Fasting persuades God to do your heart’s desires.",

         "introduction": "Each time you fast and pray, you exchange your weakness for the strength of God.  The weakness from fasting is a declaration and confirmation that your strength is useless, because by strength can no man prevail (or succeed) – (1 Sam. 2:9).  So, you need courage to go from start to finish and succeed. Courage is boldly confronting the things you fear.  According to Esther 4:11; Death was already there for anybody who will go to the King, if not in keeping with protocol.  Esther feared losing her life and the throne as queen. Hers was not fasting but a spiritual exercise to foster courage.  However, she had courage – courage pushed her to declare “though it is not according to law: and if I perish, I perish”.  Did she perish? No! Fasting is a fuel for courage. It helps you master and foster courage to start a thing and be able to take it to the end.  Esther did it. You and I can also do it. Hear this, everyone lives in fear of one thing or another.  No matter how clear your vision, or planning you undertake, you can hardly anticipate all the odds, issues and challenges involved in starting and finishing a project, even fasting.  But courage will make you start something and finish it, in spite of our fears.",

This makes a believer have capability to disarm the devil and take over his territories.  It is also a dimension where the Holy Spirit uses a believer to do exploit to the defeat and shame on the devil. Physical, financial and intellectual growth without a corresponding growth in the things of the spirit like word in-take, prayer powers, fasting ability, spiritual sensitivity etc still makes one remain a child spiritually speaking.  Desire spiritual growth, get committed to it and it will accord you rapid growth in other sphere of life.  Intimacy with God also sponsors spiritual growth.

         "introduction": "To become a cutting edge minister or a fire-brand Christian, you need to always back your ministration with fasting.  It could be before or after the ministration or both.  Ministration here refers to your performance before a congregation, crowd or gathering where you stand before people and do something that your voice is heard and people are blessed. The duration of the fast is basically your choice, however, not long days.  You may not need to fast 7 days for a 3-hour ministration. Jesus advised his disciples in Matt. 17:21 to add fasting to their prayer for quick result.  The reason is that where others fail you’ll succeed; where they were rejected, you’ll be assisted, and where you were rejected, you’ll be accepted. I release you for exploits via your ministrations.

Sometimes, most of the fasting we do, do not come by personal decision but by the Holy Ghost instruction.

Isaiah 30:21 admonishes, “And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, this is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye to the left”.  Instruction delivers people from destruction. One day, I was on the podium preaching, in the course of it a voice said “stop and quit the stage”.  I turn round and didn’t see who was talking. At third time of hearing that voice; I quickly stop and came down from the podium.  Another speaker mounted and got attacked.  He later fell sick for many years,.",

Secrets are revealed inside vision.  God speaks to those who dwell on vision.  God speaks in the middle of vision (Acts 10:19).  As Peter was thinking on the vision what is this? The Holy Ghost said – do this, do that.  God does not talk to just anybody.  When your heart is empty, your ear will be deaf.  You can’t do anything! The reasons why many have not heard the Holy Ghost say anything is because they are not dwelling on any vision (work plan to get ahead or proposal to grow in faith etc).

Why did they have to separate Paul and Barnabas? They had attained a favourable dimension of spiritual growth.  They were conversant with having fasting as a backup and they have known how to prompt or provoke the Holy Ghost to speak to them as and when need be.  Hear this, the Holy Ghost speaking to them was an indication that He was willing to work with them and empower them to do exploit wherever they go. Can we have this as a vision during this fast?
