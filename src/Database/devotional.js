         "introduction":"Praise the Lord! Today begins the season of our 40 days fasting and prayers (July 1st – August 10th, 2022).  The Lord is your strength, Amen.       Fasting and prayers prepares the way for us to receive strength from God.  It is a journey, which if we acknowledge God as the one strengthening us into and through it; we will do it with ease and gain.  To walk tall and triumphant on earth, especially in this season of tribulations and attempts of taking lives, we need spiritual strength to overcome.  Spiritual strength is a tool for overcoming physical and diabolical attacks.   A brother was divinely instructed to go into fasting and prayer to ward off evil. As he obeyed, hired killers came with charms to pick him away.  They decided to hide somewhere and wait for him, after two days of not seeing him they left.  Meanwhile, the brother was in church fasting for three days.  Jesus did not only strengthen him through the fast but also shielded him from attack and charms.  That same Jesus is your strength against every unforeseen circumstance.",

         "introduction": "Fasting and prayer is often referred to as a period or season of waiting on the Lord.  Waiting signifies a time of being loaded with strength from on high. David did pray and declared: “Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even the God of our salvation, Selah (Psalm 68:19).  Divine strengthening to achieve purposes daily is what a believer receives from God as daily benefits.  In the carnal way, people smoke, drink concoctions, alcohol etc to acquire strength to do things.  Alas, look at us believers, God simply infills us with His spirit (the Holy Spirit) and that ignite, inspire and energize us to do exploit as well as our daily routines without fainting or being weary.  The Lord is your strength!  It takes discipline to wait on the Lord.  Discipline restrains.  You restrain yourself from apetite and pleasures, and you are due for a reward.  The reward is your strengthening against attacks, discouragement weariness and lowliness in life.  Amen!.",

         "introduction": "Only those who are on the wings of strength can dare fly higher in life.  Health determines the height someone can climb to in life.  Where and when a person is sick, flying high in life and making progress in his field is hindered or hampered. That’s why one of the requirements to become a high flier is good health.  Riding on the wings of strength is what God’s grace provides and bestows on those who fast and pray.  It takes strength to walk about or run around on errands or meet up with the demands of your endeavours.  What distinguishes eagles from chickens is the strength on their wings.  Eagles fly higher and chicken don’t dare fly 4ft (four feet) above the ground.  So, an eagle Christian is one who can fast and pray for days and have harvest of divine strengthening.  Whereas, the chicken Christians do not go beyond 6am to 12noon; except by favour; their exploits are not much.  We pray God grant you strength.",

         "introduction": "Grace sponsors divine strength.  Also, strength is a product of grace.  Spiritual strength is a fuel for physical strength.  Both are needed to attain success in any consideration, situation or occupation.  That is why, it is important to stress that no strength, no success. Mounting, running and walking up and upwards are functions of strength.  That is why, it is important to embark on fasting and prayer wherever and whenever success is required or demanded.  It is the period you afflict your body and soul so that your voice can be heard on high (Isa. 58:3).  In this 40-day journey, your voice shall be heard where it matters to you. Ability to dwarf others and surmount obstacles comes by this spiritual exercise and sacrifice called fasting and prayer.  As you do it, any weapon fashioned against your success shall not prosper.   God will use it to silence your opponents.  Any tongue that rise to condemn you, as you fast your prayers will condemn and if need be destroy them.  Success is yours no matter what!",

         "text": "Phil. 4:13, “I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me”.",
         "introduction": "Life brings joy in the face of accomplishments.  Lack of accomplishment often robs someone of joy.  The tone of Phil. 4:13 is that of joy because Christ had strengthened him (Paul) to achieve a lot in his life and ministry.  Imagine him being the only Apostle who wrote half of the books of the New Testament.  Every move you make with Christ will land you in joy and achievements. “All things” does not mean few things, certain things or selected things.  It means everything.  Meaning, when Christ strengthens a man he can succeed in business, marriage, family, politics and health-care.  The extension of it is that he will have fullness of joy; sorrow cannot sneak in. Christ is the channel of anointing for strength.  On one hand, he helps you rise up and take control of your life and conquer obstacles with ease.  On the other hand, he empowers you to nullify diabolical or satanic influences that they don’t wear you out or halt your progress.  By His strength you will surely have more wins.",

         "introduction": "Strength is fuelled by increase in commitment and vice versa.  Commitment is not a matter of acting on the periphery.  It is a case of going deep down to the depth in order to lay a foundation for a sustainable success.  This is one principle that applies to any endeavor in life and destiny. Jesus is the root of David.  He is the root and foundation for attaining immediate and remotest success.  He gives wisdom and power to overcome any fainting spirit enroute success.  He increases strength of the workman or work force to ensure the job or project is not abandoned or left half way through.  He empowers us with might or ability so that Satan will not mock at us believers that had started well to serve Him, then along the line we get discouraged. ",

         "introduction": "Life will come under a fainting spell if there’s no room for strength renewal.  As much as a person may claim that his life is well organize, if he does not make provision for renewing his strength; he is someone waiting for a day he will crash land – that is fall down unexpectedly and sustain injuries or die.  That shall not be your portion. Jesus ensures He renews your strength when you wait upon Him, in prayers, fasting and word study.  I tell you something, if your spiritual strength is renewed, your physical strength will follow suit.  Divine strengthening is a reward from Jesus for those who care to wait upon Him. Strength renewal is the route to personal revival.  When you are revived your strength gets boosted automatically.  Note too that personal revival is the key to your survival.  Survival boosts your immunity against life’s challenges – attacks, discouragements and unexpected odds.  So, a strive for strength renewal is a strive for survival. It’s my prayer that you will weather trials of life and weigh down all challenges to your health as you wait on the Lord in this season.  ",

         "introduction": "Go ahead, you won’t faint.  Your strength is not small.  Fasting, as a matter of fact, drains physical strength.  When you wake up in the morning or during period of a long fast, it’s like you’re going to faint.  The truth is God is allowing you wear out your physical strength in order to enhance and foster your spiritual strength. Jesus imparts spiritual strength as you wait on Him.He has the power to sustain you through seemingly fainting moment.He also has the ability to divert adversity away from you.Acknowledge His presence with you and all fears will go.As a matter of truth, fasting and prayer are tools meant to fight adversity.When you conquer physical adversity, you launch yourself into spiritual prosperity.",

         "introduction": "Going into fasting and prayer is going for knowledge of how you can improve your lot in life.  Fasting arouses spiritual sensitivity.  Spiritual sensitivity is like an envelope that contains revelations, knowledge or divine ideas.  It opens you to an atmosphere of inspiration and vision for creativity.  Fasting primes you to go for these set of knowledge. Experiences of being in a trance, having dreams where things are revealed to you and having pictures that tells you the way out of certain hitherto confused situations.  In short, fasting coupled with prayer fuels solutions.  Please exploit every opportunity of it.  Your mental strength is guaranteed as you fast and pray.  Your strength is increased when your knowledge receives a boost.  Knowledge is power.",

         "text": "Prov. 24:16, “For a just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief”.",
         "introduction": "Two classes of people are contrasted in the text above, namely: the just man and wicked man.  The first man will always rise and thrive, even though he falls, because of his innocency.  A Just man, that embarks on a fast benefits because of his right standing with God.  So, there is always a spiritual strength to make him rise after a fall. so with the wicked man; because he is not sowing a good seed and he is not having a right standing with God.  Therefore, he falls back into his mischief as a dog that goes back to his vomit.  This is why the wicked has no spiritual strength to rise after a fall. For a just man to fall seven times and still rise up each time is a tone refection of the state of his heart towards God.  King Hezekiah taught us this lesson:  see “how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart” (Isa 38:3).  God helped him revive and prevented him from falling into the grave.  A just man has a perfect heart and so will rise after each fall.  May you and I not miss this secret of recovery.",

And Jabez called on the God of Israel, saying, Oh that thou woudest bless me indeed, and enlarge my cost, and that thine hand might be with me, and that thou wouldest keep me from evil, that it may not grieve me?  And God granted him that which he requested”.",
         "introduction": "	Prayer changes things.  In the journey of life, you need prayers to bring changes in your mood and life as time goes on.  That’s why you must not enter into prayer and fasting casually but carefully, so that you know what to change or allow in your life.  You cannot be sick and you feel it is normal, without addressing it as your prayer focus.  What you address in prayer is what you achieve as your proof and testimony of answered prayers.  The prayer of Jabez has shown us the way, just in case somebody was ignorant of this.  Answered prayer is a function of the action you take and words you declare to yourself in the place of prayer.  There may be electric light in your room but until you take the action to switch on the light and tell yourself you need this light, you will still be living in darkness.  Even if you do fasting and don’t decide to take the action of turning on the socket to give you light, nothing will happen.  Your decision to effect a change is the key to answered prayers.",
