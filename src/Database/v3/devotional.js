    introduction:
      "Welcome to the beginning of FULGA annual 40 days & 40 nights of prayer and fasting starting today, 1st July till 10th August, 2024. I pray that God will use this programme to make several breakthroughs come forth in your life and family. Our God is a God of possibilities. Possibilities refer to positive and profitable outcomes in our favour. It is a spiritual principle that we will enjoy possibilities by our prayer and fasting. This is the message Jesus passed to His disciples when they saw Him heal a child who was afflicted by a dumb spirit. Know that by your prayer and fasting in this season: Spiritual, financial, intellectual and relational possibilities will come forth for you. We do hear with God all things are possible. It is our prayer and fasting that prompt God to make things happen for your good. Prayer and fasting are agents of positive transformation. Both help to put a smile on our faces and push shame out of our lives. Your story will change for the better this year as you are lifted, Amen.",

    introduction:
      "May all obstacles be divinely cleared from your life as you fast and pray today and days ahead, Amen. Prayer and fasting have a combined power to produce a desired result. Both of them have the efficacy to stop the devil or sickness from afflicting and disturbing somebody. Jesus Himself while on earth was a prayer and fasting machine. He fasted for 40 days and 40 nights and got the audacious faith and power to run an excellent ministry and fulfilled in three and half years. That was why it was easy for Him to rebuke and command that sickness out of the boy's body. Moreover, anywhere He went He was doing good. Acts 10:38 (KJV) makes it clear: \"How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.\" Power is a product of prayer and fasting. Fasting and prayer also have the capacity to attract divine presence and power which do work out things for the Believer's good. This fasting programme in this year of our lifting will surely upgrade us as a family and individuals. I pray that God keep us immune to any satanic onslaught.",

    introduction:
      "I pray for you that Jesus should continue to rebuke every evil targeted against your life and endeavours throughout this year, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ, Amen. Join me to pray: O God rebuke the devices of the crafty in this second half of the year, so that their hands will not perform their enterprise against me and my family. Keep praying this as you fast and pray. Rebuke is a shout of restraint to stop any evil from taking place or harm from perpetrating (or continuing). It is a violent voicing of condemnation to halt a derogatory or negative condition. In FULGA, \"Rebuke ... and the response ssoi\" is a prayer slogan that instantly silences any adversity or chases away any calamity. It is always a sharp shooting weapon against any fierce attack or attacker. Our rebukes do fetch us sure conquests and answers. In Mark 9:25-26, Jesus rebuked the foul spirit and it left the boy instantly. So anytime we issue a command of rebuke against devourers, we are following the example of Jesus Christ and we must have victory. Amen.",

    introduction:
      "In this season of prayer and fasting, whatever was giving you sleepless nights will leave you alone from today, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. Glory be to Jesus for teaching us a great lesson with the weapon of rebuke. Rebuke is a word and weapon that triggers emergency victory against any emergency battle. Verses 25 & 26 of Mark Chapter 9 expresses the glory of Jesus Christ of Nazareth that by the word of rebuke from His mouth all barriers to your healing, victory, success etc can be broken unconditionally. By His rebuke the foul spirit left the boy instantly. As we fast and pray, join me to plead: LORD JESUS, rebuke every devourer for my sake and open Heaven in my favour, let this leap year's July fasting and prayers fetch me and my household tangible testimonies. Amen. Tangible testimonies are visible and touchable testimonies. Am sure after the healing, what the father of the boy did was to look at his son, touch the boy's head and run his hands all over the boy's body. This year, I see you touch and run your hands on your new car, new house, new born baby and wave to Heaven saying: \"This is the LORD'S doing; it is marvelous in our eyes.\"(Psalms 118:23). Amen.",

A season of prayer and fasting is an intensive session of speaking from God and hearing by man. Until you listen intensely, you cannot hear Him clearly. Listening is a skill that requires your zeal to benefit from it. You must reserve your energy to listen to what God is saying to you so as to enjoy the good of the land where you dwell. Hearing from Heaven demands concentration to receive and a determination to act or carry out what you have heard. Those who act out what they have heard from God always stay ahead with ease. Look round, if you see a man struggling with his assignment, that is a man who has not heard clearly from God what his purpose on earth is. Friends, let's take time to listen to God and we will not lack good news upon our endeavours. Life is more spiritual than physical. Draw from the source by your hearing grace and you will be exempted from disgrace. Amen.",

Life thrives well when the right demands are made from God and man at the right time. You must know how to make right demands concerning the kind of task you have at hand. It is the knowledge of the right demands to make that sponsors the right decisions to take concerning your endeavours and journeys for successes. Mark 9:24 (KJV) - \"And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.\" The decision of this father to go to Jesus was because he had a right demand to make before Him. The demand he made on Jesus to heal his son did not fall on deaf ears. He had an answer on time. Jesus' presence and power are with us as we fast and pray. The question is, have you made a demand on His faith to help your unbelief over a matter still bordering or worrying you?",

A season of prayer and fasting is a time of bringing to memory those things once known but now forgotten. You can place a demand on Jesus to heal your forgetfulness and give you reminders concerning crucial issues about your life. The disciples of Jesus set this example for us to follow. Mark 9:28 (KJV) \"And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, why could not we cast him out?\" They went to Jesus and place a demand: Lord Jesus teach us once more. In case you have lost memory of what you used to do before that shot you to the realm of excellence but now you are no longer at that height. It is time to go and learn at his feet.

    introduction:
      "It is my prayer that your private prayer unto God will fetch you your desired result in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. No prayer works faster than the private prayer you pray alone in your closet. Many people have had tremendous testimonies concerning that. Private prayer has the capacity to exert pressure on God to attend to your needs and grant answers to your request. A man alone with God in prayer is a man desperate for an answer. The story goes that Jacob was desperately in need of a change of story concerning his life. He had left Laban, his uncle, whom he served and stayed with for 21 years. He needed to leave his uncle and get himself established and his family. He was also going to meet Esau, his senior brother whom he had offended. Jacob tried many strategies to appease Esau and none worked out until he resorted to being alone and wrestled with an angel in prayer. He made a desperate declaration to the angel: 'I will not leave you unless you bless me' (Gen. 32:26). He blessed Jacob and changed his name to Israel. After this, Jacob was able to reconcile with Esau (Gen. 33:4-6). Beloved, there is nothing your private prayer cannot do. Jesus answers private prayer. One big lesson to learn here: when all strategies have failed to produce results, try a private prayer strategy. You will be glad you did. You will obtain prompt answers to your adverse experience.

    introduction:
      "May God grant you the privilege to engage in a regulated prayer life that has the tendency to reverse evil verdicts in your favour, Amen. When the whole world is against you, regulated prayer life will stand out to vindicate you from allegation or blame and shame. Daniel's story gave us an example. Prayer gathers power when done consistently and without wavering. A consistent prayer fuels continuous action or counter-action to bring forth a change of verdict. It was decreed, agreed, and planned that whoever will pray within an interval of one month will be put in the lion's den for the lions to consume him to death. This did not happen to Daniel because of his private prayer life strategy. This should go a long way to teach a user of this devotional not to joke with his or her private prayer life strategy. Another lesson to learn is that your private prayer life enables you to arrange for your victory and favour well in advance. That means before challenges come you have already handled that in your private kneeling before God. No harm or nothing happened to Daniel. So also the encounter or conquest you secure should be preserved for a future date. May you not be caught unprepared for the battles ahead, Amen.",

    introduction:
      "I pray that your private prayer endeavour will calm God's anger against you anytime you offend or displease Him in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. The altar of private prayer is known to reverse ugly situations and appease any offence. Your private prayer altar affords you the opportunity to get God to forgive your wrongdoings. At that point, you have to try your possible best to pacify God from continuing His anger against you. When God is angry, He kills and destroys assets but it takes prompt intervention to end the destruction. David's story suffices. David was provoked by Satan to number all Israel. This is what is called National Census today. God was angry with David. David raised an altar unto the Lord. An altar represents the occasion and place where we have a personal encounter with God. We may not always make a physical altar, but there can be one established in our hearts. An altar of the heart signifies a brokenness because of certain mistakes we have made. As God sees our hearts, He is bound to forgive. As it was in David's case, God responded with His mercy. The burnt offering today represents the fierceness of our prayer fire and the peace offerings stand for the persuasiveness of our pleadings to warrant peace being restored to us.",

      "I pray for you that whatever you have done earlier and want to reverse it by your private prayers, may God make it easier for you to achieve your aim, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. The private prayer posture matters a lot in launching you into an effective prayer atmosphere. The Bible says; 'he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees.' This did show a sense of humility and a strong determination to avoid distractions of any kind. It is one thing to engage in private prayers but it is another thing to avoid distractions. Do you know that someone can be praying in his or her prayer closet and yet stops and be thinking of other things which steal his concentration and launch him into distraction? Concentration matters in commanding prompt answers to our prayers. When there's concentration, there is no room for distraction. Prophet Elijah went up to the top of Carmel in order to separate himself from people and noise from the environment. This teaches us that avoiding people and noise are sometimes useful in enjoying pleasant accomplishments in our private prayer endeavours. God sometimes sends messages to us through our minds otherwise called inspiration. Inspiration thrives where there is no distraction.",

    introduction:
      "I pray for you that there should be no adverse conditions that can steal your zeal to pray privately for a change of story, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. Zeal is the drive that helps you get something done. It comes with an inner intensity that persuades you to take as a duty that must be done no matter what. Zeal is a passion that when it grips you, you have no choice but to do what needs to be done. So, even in the dungeon, Paul and Silas did not lose their zeal or passion for private prayer. So, if you are a user of this devotional and you are joking with your private prayer life, you have no excuse. You just have to engage in prayers privately daily for your profiting. I have an inspirational counseling to give to you: Start doing something and you will start seeing miracles. It had been working for me; it should work for you or any living person. Paul and Silas wouldn't have had the miracle they had of the prison door opening if they were not in private prayers at midnight.

She went to the temple and poured out her soul to God in prayer, weeping bitterly. God heard her and gave her a son, Samuel.

He had an uncommon understanding that though a man of God tells you something, it does not mean that God cannot reconsider it based on how you approach God. Because Hezekiah prayed, God’s message through prophet Isaiah to him that he was going to die was reversed. Why? Hezekiah turned to God in heartfelt prayers, and the same God gave another verdict, reversing the death from Hezekiah to extra years of life. Beloved, heartfelt prayers will always move God in your favor. This is a kind of prayer from a broken and contrite heart.

Come to think of it, Isaiah was a prophet of prophets whose words were highly respected by Heaven and earth. Yet, that day and for the first time, the trend of Isaiah’s prophecy changed because Hezekiah prayed. This means God can still listen to you if you, from the depth of your heart, cry unto God to reconsider His stand on your case. I see many believers pray themselves out of challenges in 2024 and beyond, Amen. No man has the final say, even though he or she is being used by God.

Though a man of God may be right with a negative prophecy concerning you, you should have your way of approaching God for a change to the positive side. For Hezekiah, we are told, he wept sore. His tears stopped his death. For Jabez, his prayers granted him access to God to change a negative label of sorrow upon his life. For Hannah, her vow to give back the son to God gave her access to change her story of barrenness to a mother of a prominent prophet in Israel who was named Samuel. Tears have power to grant access to God through our prayers to reverse evil verdicts or bring the dead back to life. When Jesus was led to the grave of Lazarus, the Bible says, 'Jesus wept' (John 11:35). Then with a prayer of thanks to God, He called forth Lazarus and he came back to life (Luke 11:41-44).

Prayer is the link that connects the natural with the supernatural. Jesus gave us an example; He often communicated with God through prayer. If you can work on the prayer dimension of your life, it will serve as your secret to go higher in life, no matter what is happening on earth adversely. Sometimes, you need to add fasting.

That’s why I always like this song: 'Mercy O Lord, mercy O Lord, Father show me Your mercy, mercy O Lord.' What is the point made here? Any negative verdict should be handled in prayer. This is because prayers can turn things around. Hezekiah did not go to Isaiah; rather, he went to God and God alone until the story changed for the better. Dare to develop your prayer life. Many people miss it by resorting to men for answers whenever they have challenges.

    introduction:
      "May Heaven baptize you with the stamina to hold on to God till a positive change comes concerning your condition, Amen. Friends, we have been running a serial from Monday till today concerning the resolve of King Hezekiah to seek answers directly from God, not man, concerning his sickness and the prophecy from God that he will die and not live. Though the prophecy has a touch of finality, Hezekiah still insisted on confronting God face to face. What a faith! Job is another person who persisted and waited on God till his change came for the better. Can we still find such faith in the church today? Hezekiah took it personally, and in the end, it paid off. Job, on the other hand, attributed his plight to his sins, yet it was not time. God allowed Satan to torture him for a time (Job 18:12). Job decided to take it personally, and in the end, God turned his captivity around (Job 42:10). Decide today to hear God out concerning your condition and you will discover that it is irrelevant to run around men; David too encouraged himself in the Lord his God (Isaiah 30:6). When King Saul made a mistake, he went to Samuel (1 Sam. 13:8-14), but when King David made a mistake, he went to God (2 Sam. 12:1-22). Comparing the sins they committed, David’s was more grievous, but he did not turn to man but unto God. If it was Saul, he would have held the garment of Nathan.",

Amen. Heavy burdens are not easy problems; they are like loads that push someone downward or draw people backwards. They need to be undone for one’s endeavors to be well done and for one’s life to witness well-being. Until burdens are lifted, blessing cannot be instituted. O God, take away heavy burdens from every user of this devotional. Amen. Isaiah 58:6 counsels us that because of God’s love for us, He gives us a choice and clue on what to focus our fasting and prayer on, so that we can derive benefit from such spiritual exercise. When people still have their heavy burdens in place after a fast, it means they didn’t undertake the fast according to this divine principle of aligning oneself with God’s love. One day, I saw it written on a lorry: 'Nothing without labour, suffer before pleasure.' Fasting and prayer is a kind of spiritual suffering that fetches physical and financial pleasure. Really, the devil or enemy can suffer to inflict heavy burdens on us, but it takes a counter spiritual suffering to enjoy the victory and share the testimony.

    introduction: "May the divine stamina built into you as you fast and pray enable you to break every yoke available in your life and endeavors in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. God’s love proves His good choice for us all. He programs it that any time we fast and pray, we’ll have yokes broken. Yokes speak of bondage, lack of freedom, enslavement, being under a taskmaster, and being deprived of a feeling of joy and independence. Yokes contribute to physical suffering and denial of peace. A person under a yoke is someone who has signed in for a life of difficulties. If your fasting does not break yokes, it means your own life is yet to align with God’s love. You need to check your relationship and intimacy with God, you need to examine your life and conduct to really see whether you have actually repented or if you are living your life in feigned repentance. God’s love attracts God’s grace. God’s grace heralds God’s anointing to work in favor of or be released upon a person. 'The anointing breaks yokes' - Isaiah 10:27 puts it right: 'And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing.' The day you qualify for God’s love, evil burdens get lifted from you and yokes get destroyed from your life as God bestows His anointing upon you. Amen.",

Every time you stand before a crowd, you’re facing two camps; those in the camp of liberation and celebration and the other in the camp of oppression and suppression. The first camp consists of those who are set free, and the second consists of those still in bondage. But by God’s love, in this season and this FULGA anniversary fasting and prayers, every person in the second camp shall be set free in the name of Jesus. Amen. Fasting is a fight accentuated in the Spirit realm to turn things around for the person doing the fasting. It activates the distribution of God’s grace for every person involved in the exercise. It is also a special moment where anybody can grasp a testimony; and every testimony is an expression of freedom.

I pray God lifts you above all journey challenges and grant journey mercies to and fro, for those travelling down and financial provisions as well as personal protection to all FULGA family and friends worldwide as we mark the event on August 10th, Amen. Full Gospel Assembly (FULGA) is a spiritual seed God used Senior Apostle Donald Etim Asuquo (1932-2002) to plant on the soil of Ibiaku Ikot Ukpong, Ibiono Ibom Local government Area of Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria on 10th August, 1965, after 40 days fasting. Continuing on his stead is the waterer and President, Apostle OtoAbasi Asuquo whom God is using and lifting above all trials and challenges to keep the vision alive in the morals of Paul the Apostle in 1 Corinthians 3:6- “I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase”. We thank God for his promise to bring steady increase upon FULGA, keep the ministers and member united and working in love with the President despite the demise of the founder 22 years ago. We remember when we were faced with a situation where we felt helpless and overwhelmed. Thank God for His promise to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think. Today, in a span of 59 solid years, God has proved Himself capable of working and walking with us, sustaining the FULGA founding vision “to shine as light so that people will see and move away from the works of darkness and destruction into abundant life”. He is still on it with us. He is still doing, fueling and funding the work to ensure continued increase.",

Remember when he entered Judas Iscariot, his power worked in Judas against Judas himself, his financial fortune and ruined his future – Judas threw the money away and went on to commit suicide (Luke 22:2-6, Matt. 27:1-5). Judas died and went to Hell. Also among the twelve, Peter invited God’s power to work in Him. Then Satan came to enter into Peter but couldn’t because Jesus stopped Satan. Luke 22:31-32 says, “And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan, hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat (32) But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not; and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren”. Peter escaped death. Peter went on to desire more of God’s power in himself. So, on Pentecost day he was filled with the Holy Ghost and power and he preached, then 3000 souls were converted and strengthened (Acts 2:36-42).

    introduction: "I pray for you that, no matter the circumstances of life, your life should not be filled with fear to the extent of leaving no room for faith in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. Can a Christian’s life drop to a level of zero faith? Yes! Zero faith means no faith. It means no room for faith in his life because every space or sphere of his life is filled with or occupied by fear. The disciples of Jesus came to this zero level of faith when “there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full (of water) – Mark 4:37. Fear took over and they completely lost faith in God until Jesus rebuked them (Mark 4:40). FULGA has just finished her 59th anniversary, even if your finances have gone down to zero, that should not mean you exercise zero faith concerning God supplying money back to you. Just have faith that God will supply (Phil. 4:19) and so shall it happen. Faith matters. No faith makes matters worse, how? Because people at the level of no faith struggle through life. “Fear not” is mentioned 365 times in the Bible, which means you and I are commanded to “fear not” every day in the year. 365 days makes one year. Fear not speaks of more faith. No faith refers to more fear. A life of more fear only leads to downfall. “Faith more” speaks of increase or growth in faith daily. When trials and challenges come, you need to pray like the Apostles: “And the Apostles said unto the Lord, increase our faith” (Luke 17:5), Amen.",

Start today to pursue a big vision for your life and you will not die small. Like mentioned yesterday, fear is the reason for little faith. Don’t be fearful be faithful and you will be useful to God, yourself and humanity. A life of zero or little faith still makes Jesus displeased with us because this kind of life does not make us superior to Satan. Now, let’s follow the formula of Jesus in the text. He simply stood up and rebuked (shut down on) the wind and sea and there was great calm. Meaning, we are to control negative situations, not them controlling us.

    text: "Matthew 8:10 - \"When Jesus heard it, he marveled, and said to them that followed, verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel\".",
    introduction: "May your faith distinguish you in the midst of the good and enlist you among the great and mighty in Jesus name. Amen. When your faith is great, you stand out of the crowd and gain admission into the hall of fame and realm of greatness. Great faith sponsors great fame and a great name. As Jesus entered Capernaum, a centurion (a Roman officer) asked Jesus for the healing of a servant. Jesus offered to go with the centurion to his house but he said no, “I don’t deserve to have you under my roof” (Vs. 8) instead, speak the word and my servant shall be healed. Jesus spoke and the servant was healed. Jesus is able. Now, a man with great faith will always have things work out as he desires. He had faith in the word of Jesus. He also had faith in the person of Jesus. How? “For I am a man under authority …” (Vs.9). The Greek word expressing the idea of “authority” is “exousia”. It is also translated in English as “power”, however, the basic meaning of exousia is that of “freedom of action”. Jesus is a man with authority but the centurion a man under authority. So, a person with authority has greater freedom to act than a person under authority. That’s why the centurion could not host Jesus in his house. Moreover, he had great reverence for Jesus. So, your faith will be rated as great faith if you hold your pastor in high esteem and greatly believe the word from his mouth (2Chron. 20:20). Many believers are struggling; living in fear and doubt because they, ignore their pastor and despise his word.",

    introduction: "I pray for you that, in moments of sickness as you touch the pages of the Bible, may you draw virtue for your healing, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. The healing virtue from God is always available through His word. You can tap into it as you draw inspiration from His word to solve your problem or enjoy His healing; Faith cometh by hearing (Rom. 10:17). As the woman with the issue of blood heard of Jesus, her faith for healing stirred up in her, then, the inspiration and declaration to get healed pushed her to touch him and draw virtue for her healing instantly. Faith without work is dead. Meaning, faith sponsored or followed by action will promptly yield result. The anointing for healing was available but her faith drew it out. When she drew it out, Jesus felt it and turned round and said virtue has gone out of me (v. 30). So, virtue drawing faith is not a superficial venture but a deep seated exercise fuelled by strong determination and involves the entire of one’s being to get out and get it right. You won’t miss it!",

It is a daring, desperate, 'careless' and unyielding faith that does not and will not bend until it sees the desired result at the end.

Unfailing faith reminds us that faith can fail through the prompting and manipulation of Satan. As seen above, it is only Jesus that can step in and baptize you with the grace of unfailing faith. He did for the three Hebrew boys in the burning fiery furnace. Daniel 3:24-25 tells, 'Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste, and spoke, and said unto his counselors, did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, true, O king. He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the son of God.' Unfailing faith does not thrive by human effort but comes through by divine intervention so that the oil of God upon the anointed is not ridiculed. Another example is that of Paul and Silas in Philippi prison (Acts 16:25-26). I pray Jesus accords you such privilege.",

Unyielding faith is the faith that does not obey or observe protocol or yield formal way of doing things. It is the faith that leads someone to do things the way he/she desires, however, not with the intention of being disobedient or rebellious but simply obeying the leading of God. It also takes a heart preparation and determination, irrespective of whether one will perish or not until the desired favor is obtained. Esther applied unyielding and fearless faith and got favor from the King (Esther 5:1-3). The King told her, 'What is your request? It shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom.' Another person that unyielding faith worked for was Job (Job 14:14, 15). 'If a man dies, shall he live again?

    introduction: "I pray for you that your life reflects reverence towards God in all your public speeches and secret actions in the name of Jesus, Amen. Make your life a testament to God’s glory like Joseph. He made his life continually seeking to honour God. He did not sleep with his master’s wife, despite the pressure and persuasion by the woman. He forgave his brothers, even though they sold him into slavery and denied him of his father’s inheritance. He did not look for Potiphar, after he became the prime minister in Egypt, to punish him or visit vengeance upon him for wrongfully accusing him and sending him to prison. Joseph’s habit, ideas, actions and thoughts, reverenced God. The word “reverence” means honour, or respect felt or shown to somebody. Joseph also had a deep reverence to hierarchy, authority and the Almighty God. Gen. 39:9 refers, “There is none greater in this honour than I”. Thus speaks of reverence for hierarchy. Joseph respected his position as an overseer in Potiphar’s house. He didn’t abuse that privilege. Let somebody, learn something here. Until your life becomes a symbol of reverence to God, you will not become a point or person of reference in life. A person of reference is someone whose life is worthy of emulation.

    introduction: "May you learn to respect yourself and your position of honour so that God can position you for higher responsibilities and commensurate rewards, Amen. In the house of Potiphar, Joseph was an overseer, the chief servant and the head in the hierarchy of workers there. He was the closest confidant to Potiphar, apart from his wife. The word, hierarchy, refers to a body of persons in authority. It is the classification of a group of people according to ability or to economic, social or professional standing. Verse 5 of chapter 39 of Genesis says. As Potiphar made Joseph overseer over all that he had, God blessed Potiphar’s house for Joseph’s sake. That means the economic well-being of the house improve greatly and there was great sufficiency of everything. The Bible went on to say, “and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field”. This was an uncommon transformation and reformation. The status of Potiphar, his household and the economic value and property rating of all his assets went higher. There was great joy and rejoicing everywhere. There are certain people you move or associate with and your life changes for the better. Joseph was such a person. May God connect us to many “Joseph” this year. Joseph respected God, and the fortune his presence had brought upon the house of Potiphar made him refuse to yield to the demand of Potiphar’s wife to lie with her. He, also, did not want to abuse and abort the privilege of his position with God.",

    introduction: "I pray you be guided by your conscience in decision making and action making so as not to launch yourself into errors or cause God displeasure. Amen. Conscience is simply a sensitive regard for fairness or justice. It is one’s internal sense of right and wrong. As the story is told of a woman who saw a missing bag, she said her conscience told her to find the lost bag’s owner. Someone once, said: “conscience is an open wound; only the truth can heal it. The noun form of conscience is conscientiousness. This is conformity to what one considers to be correct, right or morally good. The woman who saw the lost bag demonstrated conscientiousness. Joseph too, demonstrated conscientiousness. Good conscience disciplines someone to the line or follows the path of what is right or morally good to do. Gen. 39:9 is a display of good conscience, playing out on the mind of Joseph as a thought. Good conscience sponsors good thinking and good thinking is a product of good conscience. Joseph had good conscience towards Potiphar. Good conscience fuels trusts, that’s why Joseph had reverence for the trust Potiphar had in him, and avoided the betrayal of trust Potiphar’s wife wanted to plunge him into (Gen. 39:7) These days some men and women, young and old have thrown their consciences to the winds. They no longer listen to their conscience or take to the right path. They have thrown caution to the winds. But thank God, not Joseph.

    introduction: "May your presence in a position of influence bring joy to your people and those around the neighbourhood in the name of Jesus, Amen. Continuing the running story on Joseph in previous days, we see that Joseph loved righteousness and hated wickedness. That’s why God anointed him with oil of gladness above his fellow workers in Potiphar’s house (Psalm 45:7 refers). Those who carry the oil of gladness don’t inflict people with sadness. This is the reason Joseph was a channel of joy, success, flourishing and prosperity. When his master realized this, he handed everything he had except his wife, into the care and custody of Joseph. Something more to note of is that Joseph reverenced the authority of his master and lived in that house with all sincerity and without hypocrisy. If he had lived in hypocrisy Joseph would have been having secret love affair with his master’s wife without his master knowing. You know, since madam was the one that initiated it, she would have carefully covered it up but Joseph wouldn’t go far and madam would not let him go anywhere. In the process Joseph would have lost his destiny. Many men and women, young and old have lost their destinies in this manner.

Reverence is a feeling of deep respect or awe-like a good servant have for his boss. Joseph intensely regarded Potiphar, his Boss. Reverence can be a feeling of awe, and it can also describe how you treat somebody or your boss, particularly when used with the word with. That is, to treat someone or your boss “with reverence” is to show him intense respect. This was the behaviour of Joseph towards Potiphar. When you don’t treat your boss with reverence, you don’t rise to become a boss yourself. Gehazi didn’t treat Elisha with reverence that is why he didn’t live long or rise to become a boss. He had sown a wrong seed but Joseph did sow a good seed and lived to reap that great harvest. Another point to note - Joseph was not a wicked ruler over other servant and under his master that’s why whenever he led people instead of the people mourning, they were smiling, singing and dancing. In the prison, he was a leader and those he interpreted dreams for, were happy when his dreams became reality. Again, if your boss could not rejoice when you were under him or after you’ve left him, you’ve lost a point of reference.",

Integrity speaks of transparency and no hypocrisy. Integrity is having a changeless character in secret or in public. You are who you are even when no one is watching you. This was the portrait of Joseph. I pray it should be yours and mine too. When God trusts you, He can entrust things or gifts to you and compel people to entrust their assets and resources to you, to take care for them; without probing you. God created Joseph into a person who will have reverence for integrity. That’s why He gave him two powerful dreams on trust (Gen. 37:5-10) and entrusted him with the responsibility of interpreting dreams to all classes of people. What has God entrusted you with? What gifting has He entrusted you with that you need to keep with integrity? You see, Gehazi would have been someone with a double portion of Elisha’s anointing, but Gehazi lost it, because he didn’t have reverence for integrity (2 Kings 5:22-26).

    introduction: "May God give you the privilege of living a well-favoured life in Jesus name, Amen. When people notice that you are blessed with a well-favoured life, they will want to connect, associate, and fellowship with you and link their affairs to you. The grace of being well-favoured will rub off on them and upon their affairs and engagements. Potiphar revered a well-favoured life, that’s what Potiphar did with Joseph (Gen. 39:6) and Joseph, too, had reverence for a well-favoured life, that’s why he did not want to trick his master out of that privilege. He served him wholeheartedly, kept his things intact, and didn’t bring any disappointment to Potiphar. With the dreams God gave to Joseph and the coat of many colors (Gen.37:3) his father, Jacob, made for him, he stood out as a well-favoured person. Good lesson here: when you are well-favoured, use that privilege to be a blessing to someone else so that you can grow in that well-favoured dimension. You can see Joseph was upwardly mobile and never went downward in his lifetime. Also, when people want to inflict you with pains or sorrows, God will step in and stop them. He stopped Joseph’s brothers (Gen. 37:19-27). He also stopped Joseph, the earthly husband of the Virgin Mary - a well-favoured woman (Luke 1:28).",

Tithing is a process of bringing your tithe or one-tenth part of your increase to God. Every increase you have in your income, agricultural business, or any other business deserves a tithe to be paid on it. The text above says 'all the tithe is the Lord’s', meaning tithing should not be done selectively but on all the income or increase accruing to you. Tithing is not giving to God; it is simply returning to God what belongs to Him.",

    introduction: "May God use your prayers and that of the church to turn around people’s captivity in the name of Jesus, Amen. Ceasing to pray is asking the devil to take over and make you a prey. So we must all pray without ceasing. God is looking for a person or church that will pray without ceasing so that He can rise up and shoot down enemies without missing. As the church prayed in the case of Peter without ceasing unto God, God sent His angel to shoot down Herod, who put Peter in prison waiting to be killed. 'And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him (Herod), because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost'. 'Gave up the ghost' means Herod died (Acts 12:23). As you will pray without ceasing in this last quarter of the year, all the 'Herods' in your life will not see 2025. To 'pray without ceasing' speaks of keeping to a regulated, consistent and persistent prayer life; like the FULGA prayer pattern - 6am, 12noon, 6pm and 12 midnight (Nigerian time). Thessalonian Christians located in a prosperous, prominent and thoroughly pagan seaport city of Thessalonica first heard the gospel on Paul’s second missionary journey. A dynamic fellowship developed there, becoming a continual joy to Paul, but the people were being persecuted. Paul urged them to persevere and 'pray without ceasing' (I Thess. 5:17).

Remember, when you’re special to God, your thanking will remain unceasing. Amen. God, as a good father, whom He is, always feels good and glad when we thank Him for what he has done for us or what He’s yet to do for us. A story is told of a father who always buys things as he returns from work and keeps in the children’s room whether they are there or not. The children having known this will always thank the father for his gifts to them as a matter of habit. One day, the father did not buy anything and the children still thanked him. His conscience pricked him and he rushed out and bought something for the children. That father is a type of God. God, when we thank Him for what He has not yet done for us, He hastens to do it for us. Apostle Paul asking us: 'In everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you'; reveals this is our part to play. God’s part is that He will always do what we thank Him for, sooner or later. Let’s make it a habit, whether good or bad to give God thanks. If bad, He will hasten to make it good. Example – John 11:41-44. Jesus stood at the grave of Lazarus: 'And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me' - Vs. 41, Vs. 42- He cried, Lazarus come forth!

He was always telling them: 'Quench not the Spirit' (I Thess. 5:19). Meaning, don’t lower the standard or douse the fire and drown the zeal in your faith till Christ returns. Paul is still talking to us. The Holy Spirit gets grieved when we quench the Spirit with which we go about the things of God. The spirit can be quenched by the sin of omission (leaving undone what we ought to have done), yielding to the corruption of this world and by the sin of commission (doing what we ought not to have done). This exhortation is still focused on us: 'Quench not the Spirit'.

    introduction: "May you not despise but desire prophesying so that Jesus will keep satisfying your needs day by day, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. God is always satisfying our needs and fighting our battles in life and in the church. He does this through the true vessels He has been using in prophesying to us. Many of us are alive today, living for God as a product and as a result of God using His chosen vessels in prophesying to us. We believed and did not despise. Though there are genuine prophecies from God like above, there are also fake prophecies demanding money and things from us which trace their roots to Satan. We should be careful and not allow satanic agents to deceive or dupe us. We should not despise genuine prophesying – prophesying is operating directly and truly by the prompting of the Holy Spirit. Paul says: 'Despise not prophesying' (I Thess. 5:20). On the day of Pentecost, the Apostles were baptized by the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:2-4) and they began to speak in tongues. This was a sign to make the unbelievers believe that they were sent by Jesus, because they even spoke in tongues alien to the speakers. Tongues were not to convince believers because those present were already speaking. Now, prophesying is not to serve unbelievers but believers. So, believers should embrace, welcome and desire (instead of despise) prophesying.",

    introduction: "I pray for you that you don’t fall victim of fake or false prophecy, in the name of Jesus. Amen. God is always on time. He always steps in to correct things before any harm is done. The pagans in Thessalonica were trying to rubbish the ministry of Paul by laying false allegations against him. You have heard it that they had done it and threw him and Silas into prison (Acts 16:25-27). The Christians in Thessalonica had heard slander about Paul; but Paul refuted it. It was on that note that Paul exhorted them: 'hold fast that which is good' (I Thess. 5:21). Don’t be quick to believe anything said wrongly about a church or a man of God. If you don’t verify, don’t justify the claims made about them. Until you verify what’s been prophesied, don’t be satisfied. What you don’t probe, you cannot prove. God Himself said in I John 4:1: “Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.” In Acts 17:11, the Bereans were said to have been more noble than the Thessalonians: “These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.” Verify that things are so, then prove them.",

God is always right and around to guide us into our rightful destinies. If Joseph had settled down to the sexual temptations in the house of Potiphar, he wouldn’t have gone to prison. And maybe he wouldn’t have connected to Pharaoh to interpret his dreams and got a placement in destiny as a prime minister in Egypt but he fled, escaped and abstained from all appearance of evil. Hallelujah! Somebody using this devotional is next on line. In Paul’s story, the pagan and seaport city of Thessalonica was full of sexual temptations but Paul warned the Christians there: 'Abstain from all appearance of evil' (I Thess. 5:22). In verse 23, he assured them of God’s defence and still prayed for them for divine preservation and sanctification. 'And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ' (I Thess. 5:23). Paul is still warning and praying for us today, through that scripture. Nobody prayed like this for Joseph but we are told in Gen. 39:21 - 'But the Lord was with Joseph, and showed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison'.

    introduction: "May you not forget to turn to God to give you the right word that suits the occasion in which you have to speak or give a speech, in the name of Jesus, Amen. God is worth who He is because of His word. His word creates, heals, and edifies. His word also nullifies, destroys and condemns depending on what the situation demands. Words answer to the intent of our hearts. For instance, David said: 'I shall not die, but live' and he did not die (Psalm 118:17) but Samson said 'Let me die' and he died (Judges 16:29). God allows us a choice when it comes to deciding life and death by our word (Deut. 30:19). But when we express our weakness and dependence on Him, in view of what to say or how to say it, He will promptly teach us what to say. Until you consult God on what to say, you have not involved Him to help you sail through in life or endeavors. Moses told God: 'I am not eloquent. I am slow of speech and a slow tongue' (Exod. 4:10). God told him don’t worry: I will teach you what to say (Exod. 4:12). God’s word conquers all odds. Moses went with God’s word and succeeded. God’s word carries His presence in your assignment.

    introduction: "I pray for you that God touches your tongue with wisdom that you can speak as the learned, in the name of Jesus, Amen. God knows how to call people and use them for His specific purpose. He called and commissioned Isaiah (meaning 'Jehovah is salvation') as a prophet, politician (or statesman) and a poet. His tools for his assignment were a tongue and a pen. He complained and said: 'Woe is me! I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips' (Isa. 6:5) and a live coal was divinely taken from the altar and laid on his mouth (Isa. 6:6-7) and the tongue of the learned was given to him (Isa. 50:4). He wrote 66 chapters in the Bible on a book-Isaiah named after him. In the first 39 chapters, the Prophet stresses righteousness, holiness and the justice of God. The other 27 chapters portray God’s glory, compassion and undeserved favour, prophesying that a messiah shall come as a savior to bear a cross and as a sovereign to wear a crown. I pray God prepare and protect you for your greatness. Amen! In order to reflect his name, Isaiah stood toe to toe with the wicked kings and corrupt countrymen of Judah, delivering his unpopular message: 'Repent…. Or feel God’s righteous wrath'. Kings and officials, priests and commoners-no one was safe from Isaiah’s verbal missiles. How did it all happen? It’s because God had given him the tongue of the learned to speak to the weary and an ear to hear as the learned. May God equip you for your assignment on earth.",

    introduction: "Beloved reader, may God put seasoned word in your mouth that will flourish your endeavor and make people’s faith grow as they listen to you in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. Thank you Lord for loving us so much! When God touches your mouth, you’ll become a torch-bearer on earth. You become a beacon of light in the midst of darkness. Like prophet Jeremiah who preached God’s word in Judah after Isaiah. He preached against Apostasy, Idolatry, perverted worship, moral decay-for these and other sins, judgment was foretold. But Judah’s response was not repentance but rejection, as the prophet experienced opposition, isolation and imprisonment. Through 40 years of fruitful duty, Jeremiah saw many of his prophecies fulfilled, including God’s final judgment on Judah: her downfall and exile. I pray God should put words in our mouth such that no matter the economy of the nation we will still stay financially buoyant and fulfill destiny. Called at a young age and at first reluctant to answer the call (Jer. 1:16), Jeremiah undertook the function of being God’s prophet to wayward Judah. In Jer. 1:9, God touched his mouth and put words in his mouth. When he wanted to run away and abandon the work, God’s word was like fire in his bone (Jer. 20:9). He stayed on and finished well. You too can receive grace to finish well and finish strong. Jonah, too, wanted to run away but God stopped him.
