            "Strength is essential to shield us from the stresses and strains of life and endeavours.",
        introduction:
            "Jesus plays a-triple-role as far as divine strength is concerned.  He is a channel of strength (Phil. 4:13).  He gives and increases strength (Isa. 40:29) and He is involved in strength renewal (Isa. 40:31).  In case you lost your strength in any area of life.  Come to Jesus.  You cannot give what you don’t have.  Jesus Himself waited for forty days and forty nights (Matt. 4:1-11) to receive strength from God, the father.",
        main_point: [
            "Waiting to get strength renewed or endued is important.",

                answer: [
                    "A type of Christ, like Moses, a Deliverer and law giver as well as Elijah a Prophet and destroyer of baal(idolatry); also fasted for forty days and harvested strength.",

                question: "Can divine strength be transferrable?",
                answer: [
                    "Yes; Moses gave divine strength to Joshua and seventy Elders while Elijah gave his to Elisha, Jehu and Hazeel (1Kings 19:17).",

                    "Prayer is communicating with God. Cite the biblical instances:",
                answer: [
                    "In the Garden of Eden, God and man simply talked – Gen 3:8-13",
                    "Now we pray and petition with thanksgiving - Phil. 4:6-7.",
                    "First mentioned of prayer (calling on His name) was in Gen 4:26)",
                ],

            {
                question:
                    "Fasting means denying our bodies of its usual provision and pleasures.",
                answer: [
                    "Bible mentions denying yourself: food and water - Exo. 34:28, Deut. 9:9",
                    "Fasting was ordained for the church by Jesus - Mark 2:19-20, Luke 5:35.",
                    "Married persons may fast from sex – for a time, by mutual consent, to pray - 1 Cor. 7:4-5.",
                ],
            },
        ],
        conclusion:
            "Fasting and prayers help you to develop immunity that barricades your life from harm.  No sickness ever came upon Moses, Elijah and Jesus.  Those who rose against them died for their sakes.  These three forty-day fast mentioned in the Bible were all miraculous in nature, and initiated by God... not the one fasting (Moses, Elijah, Jesus).  Don’t go on long days dry fast if God does not instruct you to.",
