To be humble means we will be conscious of our weaknesses and quick to give credit to God and others for what we accomplish. (John 3:27, 5:19, 14:10, James 4:6). We must be humble because we are single apart from Christ (Lk. 18:9-14) and can boast of nothing (Rom. 7:18, Gal 6:3) except in the Lord (2 Cor. 10:17). We are dependent on God for our fruitfulness and can accomplish nothing good without the help of God and the help of others (Ps. 8:4-5, Jn 15:1-16) God delights in those who walk humbly - Isa. 57:15, Micah 6:8 – He gives an increase of grace to the humble but opposes the proud (Jos. 4:6, 1 Pet. 5:5). As believers, we must live in humility towards one another considering others more important than ourselves (Rom 12:3)."
        }
    ],
    conclusion: "Humility is the character of God and pride is the symbol of Satan. God, of course, is the most humble person in the universe; He regards the lowly (Ps. 138:6). Thus, He demonstrated it right from the beginning of time when He left His exalted position to pick the form of man – a nobody and made of him what he is today."

From our text above, you'll agree with me that the prophet Elijah was a son of his father, you see, he called himself 'man of God', this is the height of true sonship. He knew he'd come of age as a mature son to display some of his father's abilities, God responded immediately because the father knows the son's voice, deep calls to deep! To manifest, you must be a son!",
