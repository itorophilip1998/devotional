        introduction: `May your riches keep increasing as your years on earth keep increasing, Amen.
      The story of Solomon begins with how he went to the temple in Jerusalem and sacrificed a thousand burnt offerings, and then went home. God visited him in the night and asked him what he wanted. Solomon told God he wanted wisdom (an understanding heart) to know how he should do his work. That is, Solomon had a Kingdom mindset; he was not after riches. That’s why God granted him his request and added riches, honor, and long life to him (1Kings 3:3, 4:9, 11-14).
      Increase in riches happens to those who are sacrificial givers. Whenever you indulge in a sacrificial lifestyle, God always shows up to meet your needs and increase you more and more on every side. May it be so for you.
      Solomon exceeded all the other kings during his time because of his Kingdom lifestyle and sacrificial attitude. In this leap year 2024, what are you willing to sacrifice to the glory of God? If you do, you will see how God will so lift you to the amazement of yourself and many people in your locality. God’s commitment to increase us does not stop with one generation but with all generations. As He did in Solomon’s time; He is still doing it today.

        introduction: `This year, may the increase in your wisdom be recognized and known abroad.
      Wisdom is a tool that takes someone to and keeps him/her at the top. It makes you see opportunities where others don’t and helps you know how to amass it to your profiting. A man of wisdom is a man that has answers to challenges. The power to get wisdom is from God (Isa. 48:17 and James 1:5). The heart to apply wisdom is first to help others solve their problems, and dividends will come to you unceasingly.
      Increase in wisdom upon Solomon was because he had the heart to serve as a solution provider to many. He provided a solution to the true mother of a child struggled over by two harlots (1Kings 3:25-27). This brought him fame and favor throughout the whole Israel and beyond, as far as his name was heard. This made the Queen of Sheba travel down to see Solomon and share her challenges with; for him to proffer a solution. With the help of God, Solomon became a solution provider to her. She blessed him with sumptuous wealth.
      The whole city will be frenzy, all to your advantage, because of the grace of an increase in wisdom upon you. Like Solomon, you will go from increase to increase. People will marvel at the influx of favor in your direction. People will look up to you with more respect.`,

      The tendency to faint is an indication that strength is lacking and not increasing. God made man and imbued him with the strength to bring forth children. You need an increase in strength to keep triumphing in the race of life. Throughout this year, your strength will not be abated; rather, it will keep appreciating and climbing up.
      You will be divinely energized to go about your endeavors. Where others are fainting, you will see yourself flying. When others are slowing down, your story will be that of a man or woman soaring higher because God will so make His divine winds blow beneath your wings and propel you higher and farther on the ladder of destiny.
      You will never faint in the day of adversity; you will ride and rise prosperously and your strength shall not be small but take you to greater heights. The entire year shall be your season of accelerated increase.

      No door of favor shall be closed against you and all that concerns you. People will come from far and near to contribute to your success. Success will visit all your thoughts, and all your positive thoughts shall come to reality.

      The month of January is the youth of this year 2024. We need to imbibe certain attributes and good traits that will carry us safely through the months of this year till December 31st. One of it is the kind of words we speak and how we take questions set at us. We are to speak kind and not harsh words. Proverbs 15:1 teaches: “A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger”.
      The temperament of a man is assessed by the words that come out of his mouth. You must control your temper in the midst of provocation. This leap year is not a year to be angry but happy so that you can easily enjoy the flow and leading of the Holy Spirit in all your transactions and connections.

      Friend, action speaks louder than words. Our act of charity – assisting someone to rise above insult and poverty speaks volumes about righteousness and louder than the gospel we preach. Charity strengthens our chastity (purity) or identity as a Christ believer.
      Toils are reduced when we engage in charity. Yokes are broken in our favour, if we through charity help to break other people’s yokes. Put a smile on faces!
      No matter the gifts and skills we are endowed with, for ministry or Christian service, if we ignore the welfare of others; we are just empty (1Cor 13:1). Show concern about the plight of others and God will arrange a way where other people will pick your bills, stock your wardrobes and put meats on your tables.

      Purity, as a positive attribute, speaks of a strong desire to please God and shun everything that has to do with immoral and fetish practices. Purity confers on you the unction to thrive in pureness of living and being used by God as a vessel unto honour (2 Tim. 2:21).
      Purity can be rationed into two compartments – pureness of living. This has to do with how we conduct ourselves, the choices we make and good (as contrast to evil) decisions we stick to (Dan. 1:8). Here, we shun lust of the flesh and lust of the eyes. The next is pureness of heart:
      How we organize ourselves such that things that defile are not allowed to permeate our hearts. They include; hatred, anger, malice, unforgiveness etc.
      Being an example in purity is controlling ourselves such that we stay undefiled, like Daniel showcased the principle of contact without contamination so that God can use us to the glory of His holy name.`,

      Humility derives its coinage from the word humus; humus soil – which defines a kind of down –to-earth or simply lifestyle. Humility is a good virtue to imbibe and would help you thrive well in your undertakings. A humble person is someone who will never fumble and stumble in the course of his career or endeavor because he carries and enjoys the grace of God.
      Humility situates between having reverential fear for God and self-discipline to follow strictly the instructions from God which comes through His divine wisdom. Bishop Oyedepo said: “Those who hear from God don’t run around men”. He is referring to the experience that once you have instruction from God which is loaded with His wisdom, there’s no way you can fail in life or tasks assigned to you. The result a humble man gets will always humble him and others – it is always amazing! The benefit is that, he’ll be placed in a position of honour.`,

Samuel did not have ability to hear God clearly until Eli, helped him to grasp the clarity goal. It is not just enough to write a vision, you have to make it plain.

It is usually very frustrating when you pick up what you personally wrote down some years ago and cannot understand it or interpret it clearly.  No vision is fulfilled overnight; it takes a process of time.  So, it needs to be ensured that every write-up about a vision is made clear: (a) Let the visioner and supporters know what is expected of them. (b) Clearly explain the roles and their responsibilities in the vision (c) Job description and commensurate appreciation when your expectations are met.`,

      Running goal is the description of what the supporters of this vision are expected to do and what results to obtain.  In one word:  Job-description! It is to be written down so that whoever picks it can read it and clearly understand how to run with it.  Running amiss is akin to reading amiss.  Understanding is key. The Running Goal responds to the training goal. The Visioner has to train the team (paid staff )or volunteers (unpaid) in line with his vision.  He has to learn who to develop his own curriculum in line with the vision, so that he’ll be able to train others.  Your major duty (as a visioner) is to inspire and communicate your vision effectively to the understanding of your runners (volunteers or paid team).  For emphasis, effective training starts from you.  Pidgin English adage says: “Who wan carry load, na him go first put hand on the load”. Running goal is the implementation stage.  The failure or success of the vision partly lies here.  As the visioner, you should define the connection between your vision and the people’s passion.  Let them see what they stand to gain in your vision.  For instance, a vision to publish a book; the printer sees the money he stands to get printing it for you; he shows passion for the vision. In Luke 18:28, Peter asked Jesus what is in this for us.  Jesus said follow me you will “receive manifold more” (verse 30). We must train our people to see themselves in our vision.`,

      Every goal is tied to a time-frame.  Football – 90 minutes, child birth 9 months, Junior Secondary School – 3 years and so on.  Every vision, too, has a due time, otherwise called “an appointed time”. The vision for Secondary Education takes six years in Nigeria.  Commonly, we hear: “Time will tell”.  That means, things are bound to change for the better or even worse depending on the use of time.  If time is well-spent, things come good and if it is wasted, things turn worse.  The choice is yours. “For the vision is yet for an appointed time” warn us that the vision we have will come to fulfillment if we work towards that time but if we wasted time and indulge in procrastination, delay can set in.  Certain delays are not satanic but caused by wasted opportunities.  Opportunities are time-oriented-Time waits for no man.  Man waits for time. Use your time well.`,

      The interval between vision casting and vision fulfillment also includes the waiting goal.  The waiting goal refers to the time one has to hold on or put the steps to be taken on hold, till things normalize.  Yesterday, we mentioned, the visioner indulging in procrastination and time-wasting.  This is a self-inflicted delay, but there is also an externally-inflicted delays.  Like the University strikes, considering our illustration on Monday about a University student having the vision to become a professor in 15 years.  University strike can cause it to be extended by more years beyond the envisioned 15 years.  So, environmental factors can affect the fulfillment of a vision.  This is why we are encouraged, “though it tarry wait for it”. Waiting period should not be wasting season.  Waiting goal thrives and drives the vision when: - We keep working on the vision, in prayer, planning and evaluation. - Assessing our performances so far; what needs to improved, added or removed. - Inspiring and instructing ourselves that God will see us through. - Getting ready to speed our steps immediately the siege or delay is over.  Other reason for delay can be lack of finance, ill-health, crises and political upheavals.`,

Distractions or alternative views do creep in to wave focus away from the main pursuit.  So, it takes self-discipline in addition to other factors enumerated above to get a vision fulfilled. The attainment goal is realized once you are able to - Silence every opposing voice towards the vision fulfillment - Persevere through trials, environmental delays and economic uncertainties during the running state of the vision. - Encourage yourself when people and situations tend to discourage you. - Handle lack of assistance or volunteers to help you push forward on the vision. - Keep faith in God, that He’s the one that gave you the vision and He’ll help you fulfill it (1 Thess. 5:24).

      Beloved, nothing terrifies the devil like seeing a child or man of God carrying the presence of God.  He understands that fighting with such a person is, already, a lost battle. Why? The devil knows that God is strongly endeared to such a Christian or Pastor.  So, he (the devil) keeps a safe distance from such God’s beloved.  You can now deduce why some people are enjoying favour without barriers because they are carrying a component of favour called divine presence.  Divine presence is God being or going with a man or woman.  He assists him or her do whatever he or she wants to do.  He touches people’s heart to accept him or her in the beloved wherever he or she is or goes.  Apart from Isaac (in our reading today), Joseph enjoyed divine presence and was favoured (Gen. 39:2-4).  Divine presence prospers a person.

        Sometimes, you may not have to work so hard for this kind of favour. It could be the labour of your father or grandfather towards God and His work or it can simply be by His mercy bestowed upon you (Rom. 9:15-16). 
        “For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion (16) so then it is not of him that willetth nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy”.

        Friend, the favour you enjoy or will enjoy can be a bye-product of sworn blessings. Sworn blessings are often released upon a person, when such a person does something that bring out deep happiness to another person.
        For instance, saving one’s life, giving him help when most needed and taking shame and reproach away from a family or nation.
        In the Bible example, David secretly released sworn blessing upon the house of Jonathan. Jonathan was his covenant friend who helped David escape death by the hand of King Saul his father.
        He gave David hints on how to escape from his father’s attempt to kill him and so doing averted the shame and reproach that would have come for David and his household.
        2 Samuel 9:6-7 informs us how David delivered his sworn blessing upon, Mephibosheth, Jonathan’s son-though lame and rejected.
        “Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was come unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence.
        And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold thy servant (7) And David said unto him, fear not: for I will surely shew thee kindness for Jonathan thy father’s sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually”.
        Sworn blessing has power to restore somebody. You’ll be restored this year. Sworn blessing accelerated Mephibosheth to fame and his rightful placement as a prince and his due possessions given to him. Pray for yours.`,

        Teaching ministry is a healing ministry.\n People are healed of ignorance by it.\n Ignorance is an adversity because it deprives people of advantages.\n Every opportunity you seize to teach the word of God with joy, you are launching people into enjoying the advantages ordained for them in life.\n
        Go out today and introduce Jesus to somebody.\n Speak the word with joy today and somebody will be snatched from the grip of Satan, sin, and worldliness.\n
        Deliver the gospel to your family and community this week.\n You will help a soul win back his/her redemptive right.\n In return, you will enjoy accelerated favor and your life will sure be upgraded and upheld in honor.\n`,

        Water baptism is a bare doctrine of the church, anywhere, any day.\n The difference is the method.\n Some churches do water baptism by sprinkling water on the face while others do so by immersion in the water.\n
        FULGA carries out water baptism by immersion in the water “in the name of the father, and of the son and of the Holy Ghost”.\n
        Each time you are dipped in the water and brought back; you are spiritually lowered into the grave and brought back to life.\n It speaks of spiritual renewal.\n
        Philip had preached to the Ethiopian Eunuch, got him repented and that aroused a need in him for water baptism.\n
        Philip did it for him (Acts 8:36).\n May you be another Philip today and always.\n Your word will always touch lives, prick hearts, and get them willing to be baptized in water in Jesus name.\n`,

        The tendencies to be attacked by evil forces and harassed by their human agents are always there.\n A child and man of God get helped when they come under divine covering.\n
        In the name of the father is a prayer language that serves as a spiritual defense mechanism that shields us from attack and every fiery dart of the wicked.\n
        The unction for protection is imparted upon us when we speak and pray in the name of the father.\n By this, results are obtained and the devil or evil is scared from us.\n

        Since the day of Pentecost, every time Holy Ghost is mentioned, fire is envisioned and expected to show up.\n

        The Holy Spirit refers to the divine person and the Holy Ghost speaks of Divine power.\n They are used interchangeably because they are one and the same.\n
        The divine person illustrates the fourth man that appeared with the three Hebrew boys – Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the flame of fire (Dan.\n 3:23-25).\n
        The Divine Power exemplifies the great earthquake that opened the prison doors and loosened Paul and Silas and others bound in Acts 16:25-26.\n
        Note this: The Divine person responded - To Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego because of their faith – unwavering faith
        - To Paul and Silas because they sang and prayed.\n These prompted Divine power to come and help them out.\n

        introduction: 'I pray for you that are trusting God for the fruit of the womb.\n Receive grace to conceive and deliver safely in Jesus name.\n Sometimes, it can be very tedious trusting in God.\n Why? Because it may seem that what you are trusting God for will not come to reality.\n If the delay persists, insist, persevere, brave through until the breakthrough comes.\n Learn from the audacious faith of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.\n The intensity of the fire was increased seven times yet they insisted; they must trust in God (Daniel 3:19).\n King Nebuchadnezzar even threatened: “…who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?” (Dan.\n 3:15c).\n Besides the king, those who ganged up against them were many.\n Yet their trust in God never failed them.\n He will not fail you too.\n The prayer focus and language of trust from their mouths are captured in the text above.\n Read it again: Psalm 31:14, 15.\n May God deliver you from the hands of your enemies and persecutors, Amen.\n',

King of the earth and all the people; princess and all judges of the earth: Both young men and women; old men and children (Ps 148:11-12).\n Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord.\n',

    Our God is a great provider.\n He will surely provide for us when we have need in time with His name: Jehovah – Jireh (Gen.\n 22:14).\n It is good to differentiate between need and want: A need is something that is necessary to live and function.\n A want is something that can improve your quality of life.\n In order words, a need includes food, clothing, shelter and medical care.\n So, a need is a necessity or something we cannot do without while wants include everything else Eg.\n a cell phone, a car, a private jet, a wife, children etc.\n So, wants are anything people would like to have or desire.\n
    In summary, needs are what we require to survive, while wants are things we desire.\n God gives us certain skills to harness things in nature to meet certain needs for example, the skills to cultivate the land and have food on our table, to pick grass and weave into mats and roof house and live.\n But want does not easily come by human effort that is why God is deeply involved to meet our wants.\n Yes, because no matter how skillful or muscular you are, you cannot get a child unless God provides.\n We can’t satisfy our wants without God being involved.\n In needs too, God is not left out.\n As Paul prays: “But my God shall supply all your needs according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus……….\nthis means it is only God that can …………….\n`,

    Also, the word “leadeth” refers to guidance based on our listening.\n Isaiah 30:21 says: “And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, this is the way, walk ye in it  .\n.\n.\n” “Still waters” depict silent and peaceful moments.\n So, “he leadeth (guided) me beside the still waters (during silent, peaceful and sensitive moments).\n That means we need to carefully listen to God, when we are seeking guidance from Him.\n Reason: A little mistake can cause us grievous error.\n Care is key!

        introduction: `May God restore you to your rightful placement in redemption and give back to you all you have lost, in Jesus name, Amen.\n
    A restoration is a bringing back to a former position or condition, for instance, a restoration of peace after a quarrel.\n This is normalizing a relationship between man and man.\n    
    Restoration also plays a role in forgiveness.\n This is man re-aligning with God after backsliding or falling into sin.\n When we come to God in repentance, He has the capacity to restore our soul.\n Ezekiel 18:4 put it: “Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine; the soul that sinneth, it shall die”.\n Forgiveness makes the soul not to die but be restored to life.\n This is why repentance is very necessary so that our soul can keep prospering instead of dying.\n
    In confession and prayer for God’s pardon, David said: “Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit” (Psalms 51:12).\n Restoration guarantees, and delivers to us the joy of salvation.\n The mourning of death comes where there’s no restoration.\n Repentance and restoration fetch us God’s free spirit – which is the spirit of liberty.\n This upholds us to a life freedom and guiltlessness.\n`,

Cornelius had a unique grace that brought his name and deeds before God for a memorial.\n A memorial is something that keeps your remembrance alive.\n In order words, whatever is given to preserve the memory of a person, thing or an event is termed a memorial.\n For Cornelius, it was his prayer and giving life.\n He himself was not aware that his deeds have become a memorial before God until an Angel visited him to announce that (Acts 20:4).\n
	Another dimension where grace is available for a generous giver is that of angelic visitation.\n The first was a healing or recovery from death situation as occurred to Dorcas in yesterday’s devotional.\n There is no time an angelic visitation is in place that a change of story will not be in place.\n Before this, salvation was for the Jews only but Cornelius story had change the pattern positively by making the Gentiles also have access to salvation.\n One man can always make a change.\n May you be that one man?`,
